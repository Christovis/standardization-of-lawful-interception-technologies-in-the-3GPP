 Abstract
 Europe is controversially discussing whether to ban the Chinese tech
-giant Huawei from the ro
ll-out of the new generation of mobile infrastructure, better known as 5G, not least due to 
conflicting pressures from the governments of the United States and the People™s Republic of 

China. 5G is a critical infrastructure and will penetrate European soci
ety and its economy to an 
unprecedented extent. Proponents of a ban argue that Huawei is closely allied with the 
authoritarian Chinese party
-state, which could utilise Huawei equipment for espionage and 
sabotage. The argument is that banning Huawei is a ma
tter of increasing network security in 
Europe. This paper explains that while scepticism is reasonable, and the security concerns are 
valid, a ban on Huawei is not an effective solution for generating network security. Other 
technological measures 
Œ first 
and foremost better encryption, and redundancies coupled with 
vendor diversity 
Œ would be more effective, although complete network security can never be 
achieved. Scepticism of China™s influence over Huawei is reasonable. However, the idea of 
banning Huaw
ei stems, rather than from concerns over network security, from a geopolitical 
logic. In this context, a ban on Huawei would help decrease European technological dependency 
on China. The geopolitical fear is that China could leverage this dependency to ext
ract political 
concessions from Europe in the future. We argue that Europe should indeed respond to this 

challenge but instead of striving for technological self
-reliance, we discuss how the European 
Union could preserve access to strategic technology by m
eans of diversification of the supply 
chain and underlying patents, coupled with ﬁprotectionism lightﬂ. We believe this could help 
respond to the emerging geopolitical rivalry over high
-technology such as 5G while at the same 
time attempting to preserve fr
ee trade as far as possible. In short, our sceptical view on the idea 
of banning Huawei from the roll
-out of 5G in Europe does not stem from a trust in China or 
Chinese tech companies, but rather from the perspective that it is not the most effective 

respo
nse to the future challenges of 5G networks and technology dependence.

oduction
  The new 
ﬁfifth
ﬂ generation of mobile 
internet 
connectivity
 (5G)
 will unlock new 
and improved ways 
of 
using
 wireless 
technology and
 is expected to 
revolutioni
se multiple 
spheres 
of 
society
, not least 
manufacturing,
 construction, 
electricity 
networks,
 transportation
 and 
health
 care
. The 
new
 networks will
 support
 innovative 
technologies and enable 
a powerful
 increase 
in 
the application of 
artificial 
intelligence (
AI) and the Internet of Things 
(IoT
), while also
 allow
ing 
societies to
 become significantly more connected.
 The 
5G mobile internet
 has already been tested 
and 
launched
 in 
certain 
locations
, but
 is 
expected to 
launch more widely 
in 2020
,1 and 
account for around 20% of global 
mobile connections
 by 2025
.2 While 5G will 
not change the world overnight, its 
importance 
to 
society will grow 
over time 
to 
achieve 
an unprecedented 
level
.3  
For
 5G networks
 to be deployed, 
hu
ge investments in new digital infrastructure 
will be 
needed. 
The ongoing competition 
over 
5G, however, is not solely among 
giant 
tech companies racing for market share and 

royalty payments
. It is also 
turning into a 
geopolitical conflict among states, first and 

foremost the United States (US) and the

How the Track Record of the CCP Should Play into 
the Due Diligence of Huawei™s Partners and 
People™s Republic of China (PRC).
 China has 
taken an active role in
 technolog
y and 
innovation
, and C
hinese technology 
companies 
have become significant players 
in 5G 
equipment
 and
 infrastructure
 in recent 
years
. The most prominent 
supplier
 is the 
Chinese tech
-giant 
Huawei Technologies 
Co., which is
 also one of the world™s largest 
telecom companies.
  Huawei 
currently finds
 itself at the centre of 
a heated
 international
 debate 
over
 5G 
deployment
, which has 
also raised
 serious 
security concerns and accusations against 
the company.
 Western intelligence 
services 
and observers 
have expressed
 concerns
 about 
Huawei™s
 ties to the 
PRC as well as 
the company™s 
legal obligations to 
cooperate with
 the Chinese
 security 
apparatu
s.4 The
 main concern 
is 
that 
Huawei 
equipment
 could be used as an
 inroad 
for Chinese espionage, 
and 
China 
gaining 
access to data 
on 
and control over 
critical infrastructure
. Such security 
concerns
 led
 the
 US 
earlier this year 
to 
place 
a ban on Huawei
 and
 the Chinese state
-owned 
tel
eco
m equipment manufacturer

, preventing 
Huawei 
from
 participating 
in

were included 
in the build
-up 
of 
European 
infrastructure. Similarly, 
a ban o
n Huawei 
wo
uld not be an
 effective measure 
for significantly 
reduc
ing
 Chinese 
espionage, which i
s mainly carried out 
through applications and 
phishing
 rather 
than
 infrastructure. Even where 
infrastructure is necessary for espionage, 
there is little reason to believe that China 

needs Huawei equipment for its operations. 

Banning Huawei w
ould 
instead
 increase 
political tensions 
and 
contribute to a 
technological divide between a 
west
ern and 
a Chinese sphere
, ultimately 
fuelling
 the 
existing rivalry 
and 
fears of a major 
confrontation between the PRC and the US. 

Most importantly, 
however, 
there are other
 more effective means 
of 
contain
ing
 the 
security risks than banning Huawei.
 Instead, 
banning Chinese companies
 from
, or 
limiting their access to, 
Europe
™s build
-out 
of 5G
 adheres
 more 
to 
a geopolitical
 logic, 
by addressing
 political
ly 
motivated 
issues 
and
 trust
. A ban o
n Huawei 
would 
aim
 to 
weaken China™s political and technological 

influence 
in the world 
rather 
than
 effectively addressing network security 

risks.
 We believe 
instead 
that reducing 
Europ
ean technology dependency on 
Chinese vendors should be th
e policy goal 
of the EU.
 This ties in with ongoing 
European discussions o
n 
European strategic 
autonomy 
and 
European sovereignty. 
We 
are sympathetic to this approach but 
believe that the debate should not 
fully 
focus on 
strengthen
ing
 the digital industrial 
base of Europe
, since this tends to 
put the 
focus on protectionism 
rather 
than
 the 
preservation of global cooperation. 
We 
therefore discuss a different take 
on 
reduc
ing
 dependency on Chinese and US 
technology
: the question 
of how
 Europe can 
secure access to strategically important

To unfold this line of argument

 5G network security
 and

 with a brief 
summary
.  Centrality and innovation of 
5G  While previous generations of wireless 
technology 
Œ from 
1G 
to 4G 
Œ have brought
 improvements and new capabilities to 

cellular
 communications, the shift to 5G is 
predicted to
 be the most significant since 
the invention of the mobile phone.
12 The 
fifth generation of 
mobile
 technology
 will 
not only 
bring changes 
for consumers but 
also
 transform
 entire
 industries in a way not 
previously possible.
13 This also means that 
society will become increasingly dependent 

on mobile networks and 
rely on 
them
 for some of its most critical 
functions
, including 
services such as
 autonomous vehicles,
 health
 care monitoring and 
remote 
medical
 surgery, 
as well as 
emergency service 
response. 
As a consequence, society 
will 
become 
more vulnerable

 7 The shift from 4G to 5G will also be more 
complicated than past mobile 

communications
 revolutions
, as the 
intentions of 5G go beyond previous goals 
which were 
focused mainly on increasing 
data speeds 
and serving the 
needs 
of 
mobile handsets
. Instead of 
just 
focusing on 
person
-to-person or person
-to-device 
communications, 5G will also support 
machine
-to-machine networking. This 
makes 5G entirely different from previous 

technology. 
5G technology is 
expected to 
deliver three significant new capabilities:
  1)
 Enhanced mobile broadband 
(eMBB): 
higher
 data service speeds
, managing
 more traffic and more 
demanding services (e.g. faster 
download
 and upload speeds
, as 
well as 
virtual and augmented 
reality
 (VR
/AR
)).  2) Ultra
-reliable and low latency 
communications 
(URLLC): 
with 
response time
s as low as one 
millisecond
, enabling
 close to 
real
-time services (e.g. remote medical 

surgery, self
-driving cars and 
industry automation).
  3) Massive machine
-type 
communications 
(mM
TC): 
connection for a very large number 

of devices (enabling 
e.g. 
the 
Internet of Things, smart cities and 
automated agricultural 
processes).

In Europe, t
he introduction of 5G 
technology will take place 
first as
 non
-standalone (NSA) 
5G, which will use 
existing 
4G infrastructure
 and 
mainly 
provid
e higher 
data speeds
, to 
eventually 
be followed 
by 
standalone (S
A) 5G, which 
will 
require an 
entirely new network 
architecture
.15 A cellular mobile network functions 
essentially through the connection
s between
 mobile devices, through a 
Radio 
Access 
Network (RAN) 
that 
consists mainly 
of base stations
 (such as antenna towers)
 and a core network. 
Standalone 5G 
technology will bring changes to both base 
stations and the core 
network
, and
 make 
the distinction betwee
n 
the
ir functions
 less 
clear
.16 One of
 the 
most 
important 
change
s with
 the shift
 to standalone 5G
 is 
its
 new 
virtualised core technology. 
By replacing 
the previous core network
 (Evolved 
packet 
core)
, which
 relies
 mainly
 on physical
 network
 elements, 5G will introduce a 
virtualised
 core designed for software
-based infrastructure
 running on standard 
servers
.17 This will 
enable features 
such as 
Network Function Virtuali
sation (NFV) and 
network slicing.
18 While cloud computing is 
not new in itself, these features enable new 
aspects 
of cloud use that extend beyond 
storage
 to 
includ
e communication and 
remote 
real
-time services
. In other words,
 software and cloud functions 
are essential 
to the new 5G 
technolo
gy and
 will therefore 
become
 increasingly important

 There can be little doubt

 More recent
 concern
, however, 
has focused on 
various 
pieces of 
Chinese legislation, in particular China™s 

Cyber Security Law of 2017
, which legally 
requires Chinese companies to turn over 

information and comply with 
China™s

essentially 
on 
all matters
, Œ not 
just 
domestically (article 14) but also 
internationally (

s of effective 
party
-state control over the company.
31 Moreover, 
of 
Huawei™s 160,000 employees, 
12,000 are 
party 
members
, and they 
form 
no 
fewer 
than 300 
party 
cells within the 
company. Furthermore, Huawei receives 
preferential treatment, not least by means 
of soft loans 
which
 already 
amount
ed 
to 
more than US $30 billion before 2011
, mostly from the state
-controlled China 
Development Bank (CDB). In the period 

201
2Œ2018, CDB and another state
-controlled bank, the China Import Export 
Bank, granted the company at least another 
US $9.8 billion for overseas projects.
32 Strikingly, however, Huawei is not 
that
 different from any other Chinese company. 
In fact, even the su
bsidiaries and joint 
ventures of non

, such as 
Ericsson and Nokia
, face 
Chinese

large
-scale deployment of Huawei network 
equipment would 
provide such a kill switch 
and 
make it easier for China to shut down 
5G infrastructure.
 While it is unlikely that 
China 
would shut down 
an entire 5G 
network and 
risk
 irreparable damage to 
Huawei™s
 reputation
 in 
times of peace
, such 
a switch
 could be used 
for partial 
shutdowns
, accompanied by 
coercive 
threats
, or 
used 
in the event of an interstate 
wa
r.  Commentators and policymakers
 in the 
west
 also 
fear that Huawei™s 5G equipment 
could
 come 
with backdoors that
 would
 allow 
undetected
 Chinese 
access
 and 
enable 
economic and political espionage
. There are 
similar 
concerns 
that

vulnerabilities

47
 However, 
experts have also
 pointed out that mobile internet 

infrastructure has not been the
 main
 focus
 of
 Chinese espionage
, and that 
spear
-phishing 
and social engineering 
are more 
efficient
 for such purposes
.48
  Assessments made by the United 
Kingdom™s Huawei Cyber Security 
Evaluation Centre
 (HCSEC) 
suggest
 that 
Huawei™s equipment comes with 
serious
 weaknesses
, a problem 
irrelevant to
 the 
origin of the vendor

 indicates tha
t access could easily 
be 
obtained

s. In addition, 
British experts 
at the HCSEC 
make clear 
that no certification can rule out the 

existence of backdoors and malicious 

code.
49
 Since
 hackers normally focus on 
tracking weaknesses in the equipment of 

competitors, 
non
-Huawei equipment 
would 
also 
be a more likely target for Chin
ese 
espionage.

 technology will bring new challenges
, mainly 
through
 its technological 
innovations
 and the increase
 in 
network 
dependenc
y throughout 
society
. New forms 
of t
echnological 
security 
risk
 arise 
primarily 
from 
the
 increased 
use
 of
 virtuali
sation
 and 
of 
centralised software
. The software focus, 
as well as 
the transfer
ring
 of
 functions from 
the core network to edge computing, create 
larger 
attack surfaces and 
greater 
opportunities to introduce vulnerabilities, 

which, in turn, 
enables 
methods 
to access 
and
 control 
data on the network.
51 In 
addition, a
s virtual servers
 replace 
specialised hardware
, different parts of the 
network technology will no longer be 
physically isolated from each other
, which 
means that if 
one vulnerability is found, it 
could
 potentially
 be 
exploited to access 
other parts of the network
. In other words, 
it 
could make the
 damage m
uch more 
dramatic
 if a vuln
erability 
is found and
 exploited.
52  Security concerns also arise 
from
 the use of 
network slicing
, which 
entails
 separating
 flows of da
ta on a network
, and 
creating 
slices
 that can be 
used for
 different services
 by 
tailoring 
their use of functions
 to the 
requirements
 of
 each service
. Ensuring that 
each network slice is secure 
will be 
a challenge, 
and there are
 potential
 risks 
that
 vulnerabilities
 in one slice
 could
 be 
used to 
access 
traffic on 
other slices

 13 also concerns
 that
 targeted attacks on 
specific slices 
could be motivated 
if 
what 
each slice is
 used for
 becomes known
.54  Security risks also 
arise from
 the existence 
of 
large numbers of connected devices. 
Another form
 of
 sabotage that 5G 
technology 
is 
likely 
to 
facilitate, by enabling 
massive machine communication and IoT, is 
distributed denial
-of
-service (DDoS) 
attacks. Such attacks are carried out by 

finding and hacking machines with weak 

security and us
ing
 them to overwhelm a 
website or machine wi
th more traffic than it 
can handle. With the development of IoT, 
the number of internet
-connected devices is 
expected to grow from 14.2 billion
 to 25 
billion by 2021, which increases the 
potential 
for and power of 
DDoS attacks.
55 This essentially means that
 DDoS attacks 
can be used to shut down parts of the 

internet, which c
ould
 be very serious for 5G 
networks 
given 
the importance and scale of 
the 
services 
that
 it is
 planned to support.
  
In a nutshell, the specific vulnerabilit
ies
 of 
5G networks lie mainly i
n the 
complexity 
of 
5G infrastructure 
resulting from
 technological innovation 
(discussed
 above)
 and the multitude of use cases penetrating 

future 
societies
. It is the centrality of 5G 
to 
the 
economies and 
societies
 of the future

 The risks of sabotage and espionage are

valid concerns and should be

mitigated as best as 
possible.
 However, banning Huawei from

 In 
addition
, excluding Huawei from European 
markets would not change the fact that 
non
-Chinese companies, such as Ericsson 
and Nokia,
 will 
continue to
 face 
the same 
challenges and legal environment as 

Huawei 
in 
any production 
or 
business they 
have located in China.
 Responding to recent development
s, i
n 
September 2019, Huawei founder Ren 

Zhengfei 
offered to sell access to the 
company™s 5G code, patents, 
licenc
es, technical blueprints and production 
expertise 
to a foreign company in return 
for 
a one
-off 
fee. However, this offer 
is 
irrelevant as long as 
there is no
 buyer.
 Ericsson and Nokia have no technological 
need to purchase Huawei™s source code,
 and
 US compa
nies have no interest
, not least 
due to 
the 
lack of political will. 
Regardless 
of which company provides it, security 
concerns 
would persist 
over Huawei 
equipment
, as well as the fact that any 
buyer would still 
probably 
need to produce 
much of it in China.
61 The case has also been 
made that Huawei 
licences 
will continue to 
come 
under Chinese law
, which would 
require 
compliance with the PRC™s security 
services.
62  In short, the existing vulnerabilities of 5G 
networks need to be addressed, but neither 
a ban o
n Huawei nor 
the purchase of 
its 
source code 
would provide 
a sufficient 
solution beyond marginal improvements 
in 
European mobile network security. A

Remedies
 to network security risks
 While there is no solution that would 

effectively eliminate these network security 

risks, there are ways to reduce them and 
make it more difficult for anyone 
Œ not just 
China 
Œ to disrupt future networks. A 
number of possible measures have been 
brought up 
for discussion, such as greater 
redundancy of equipment and diversity of 

vendors, as well as the use of encryption, 
certification and assessments, and network 
flow monitoring.
  Redundancy
 and 
diversity
 are 
interlinked 
and
 about
 improving 
resilience 
and 
sec
uring 
availability of coverage. 
Their purpose
 is to 
provide
 an overlap of equipment and 
vendors 
in case of network failures
, to 
ensure 
that 
there is always 
some 
back
-up available
. Given the critical services that are 
expected to rely on future 5G networks
, ensuring
 a reliable connection
 will be one of 
the most important aspects of network 

security.
 Time and again, technical experts 
have 
emphasi
sed how crucial 
redundancy 
and divers
ity are, most recently during an 
expert hearing 
in 
the German 
Parliament
.63 Diversity of 
vendors
 means
 ensuring that 
many different actors participate 
in 
the 
market, in order to 
prevent networks from 
becoming 
fully rel
iant 
on 
a single supplier
.64 The logic is essentially that
 different 
vendors
 are unlikely to be subject to the 
same problems at the same time.

 16 recently, the Council of the European Union 
explicitly acknowledged the importance of 

vendor diversity.
66 Similarly, n
etwork 
redundancy
 refers to
 building
 additional
 layers of equipmen
t within the network
 infrastructure (
for example
 base stations)
 provided by 
multiple
 vendors
.67 The 
aim 
is 
to ensure
 that
 alternat
ive equipment

for
 network

s to fall

malfunctions
. While e
nsuring network 
redundancy 
can be
 costly, 
it is also
 effective 
at 
minimi
sing
 the risk of
 large
-scale 
network failures.
68  
Encryption
 addresses the safety of data 
traffic by protecting 
the information that 
flows on 
a network
 from unauthori
sed 
access.
 End
-to-end encryption
 refers to a 
system in which only the 
communicating 
parties
 can access the encrypted 
information
 sent between them
, and no 
third party
 in between
.69 Improving data 
security by means of encryption from a 

policy point
-of
-view 
could
 involve
 devising 
standards 
of
 encryption 
requirements that 
operators 
must

 There is, however, a

ability of law enforcement to ac
cess data for 
judicial purposes.

 there are usually 
ways to 
get around encryption
 in order 
to access information.
   Another approach to strengthening 

network
 security has centred 
on
 evaluation
 and certification
 of products
 and processes
, which 
aim
s to reduce the risk 
of 
backdoors 
or 
vulnerabilities
 that could be
 easily
 exploited by hackers
. Products can be more 
or less secure, and security audits have the 

potential to 
assess the overall 
product 
quality
, while also testing
 products and 
processes 
against 
certification 
requirements
. One 
measure 
relevant 
to 
discussion
s on assessment
s is source co
de 
review, 
a process of
 evaluating
 the 
programming language of a device or other 

equipment
 to confirm it works as intended 
and to
 search for
 potential
 defects 
that 
could be exploited.

, there 
are limited

s for companies to

such 
incentive

highlights
 serious vulnerabilities in Huawei product 
code and systematic defects in the 

com
pany™s software engineering and 
cybersecurity competence
s.73 Aiming to 
replicate the UK approach, Huawei has 
erected transparency centr
es in 
Bonn
, Germany and Brussels.
74 In contrast to the 
UK, 
however, 
these centr
es are not under 
the oversight of state auth
orities.
  Even more crucial
ly, auditing and 
certification 
have their
 technological 
limitations
, n
ot least 
that 
the heavy reliance 
on software
-based solutions instead of 
hardware 
in 5G technology 
requires 
extensive 
maint
enance
 work, updates and 
security p
atches. 
This 
means
 that 
a certified 
source code
 will 
be 
continuously 
updated
, providing opportunities
 to include new 
vulnerabilities 
or
 backdoors.
 Hence, even if 
auditing and certification could prove 
a level 
of
 security of the source code at the time of 
its assessment, it 
would be 
practically
 impossible to review all p
atches individually
, leaving aside the
 vulnerabilities that can 
result from a combination of updates.
 Due 
to the complexity of today™s IT systems
, it is 
impossible
 to cover the millions of lines of 
code present in devices and equipment, 
or
 to confirm the absence of backdoors. 
In 
other words, occasional audits are 

ineffective, and attempts to assess new 

code before every update unrealistic.

. What 
complicates this issue even further is 
the fact that
 this work is complex and
 many 
operators 
involve vendors 
in the 
maintenance work o
n the mobile 
infrastructure, 
provid
ing them 
with direct 
access to 
the 
core functions of the system
. Even if 
restrictions 
were to be imposed 
on 
access for maintenance purposes,
 however,
 such as excluding certain vendors from 
making 
VPN connections to certain 
equipment for remote maintenance or 

assigning 
maintenance
 work to specific 
qualified and vetted personnel
 (as is the 
case in the U
K), auditing and certification 
would be 
insufficient measures for 
provid
ing
 meaningful reassurance of the 
security of any given mobile infrastructure 

technology
.76  
Another suggested measure 
to mitigate 
attempts 
at 
espionage
 as well
 as sabotage
 is 
network 
flow monitoring
, which essentially 
entails gathering and analysing metadata.
 Operators have access to information about 
the data that flows int
o and out of their core 
network, and could therefore track data 
in 
order to
 detect
 and investigate
 abnormalities, such as 
traffic 
rerouting or
 leaks in which information could be 
redirected or 
transferred from the network 
to 
some
 third party.
77 However,
 while 
network flow monitoring can be used 
to 
creat
e comprehensive views of network 
activity,
 it might be less useful for
 track
ing
 specific targets or 
individuals

.79  Overall
, when it comes to increasing 
network security, measures must be taken 

with regards to technical standards for 

cybersecurity, their implementation, and 

the configuration and operation of mobile 

infrastructure. Technical standards can 
entail explo
itable security vulnerabilities, an 
issue that needs to be addressed on a global 
level at the Third Generation Partnership 
Project (3GPP), which is the most important 
international standard developing 

organisation in this field.
80
 The Council of 
the Europea
n Union emphasises ﬁ
the need 
to put in place robust common security 
standards and measures, acknowledging 
international standardisation efforts on 5G, 

for all relevant manufacturers, electronic 

communications operators and service 

providers.ﬂ
81
 The implementation of these 
standards is the task of vendors such as 

Huawei while configuration is the duty of 

mobile network operators. Finally, the 
operators™ dimension should involve 
continuous risk assessments and risk 

mitigation, including experienced
 IT 
security personnel and routines for network 

maintance.
82
 This demonstrates that 
improving network security is not just a 

matter concerning mobile equipment 
manufacturers, but involves a number of

Some 
of the 
remedies 
discussed in this 
section 
are more effective than others, but 
none 
will be 
sufficient alone
. The most 
effective way to mitigate the main concerns 
of the debate
, however,
 is to address the 
two main areas of c
hallenges that are 
anticipated for future 5G networks: 
technological risks and increased 
societal 
dependency
. The most effective measures 
for this 
are 
encryption against espionage, 
and redundancy 
and diversification of 
vendors against a kill switch.
 Together, 
these 
offer the most appropriate response 
to the risks 
posed
 by an
 external 
party
. At 
the same time, we need to acknowledge 

that it is impossible to fully exclude the risk 

of exploitable vulnerabilities and backdoors.
  Many of the risks that are 
expected 
to 
accompany
 5G technology are risks that to 
some extent already exist in networks 
today. What is essentially new in the 
development of 5G networks is 
that
 we are 
now in a situation in which
 the
 leading 
suppliers are
 Chinese.
 Banning

convinced that China has enough technical

to ban

ﬁAustralian solutionﬂ.

signed an 
agreement stating that ﬁindependent

ﬁrigorous evaluationﬂ of a

83
 Another approach, adopted for example by 

France and
 recently also 
Sweden, allows for 
the
 ban of suppliers on the grounds of 
concerns over national security
, even 
without explicitly listing criteria.
84
 Neither 
the ﬁAustralianﬂ nor the ﬁFrenchﬂ approach 
provides 
a solution to network security 
risks. Why, then, do they remain part of the 
politica
l agenda? The answer lies in the 
increasing 
geopolitical tensions over 
technology between the US and China.
  Instead of effectively mitigating network 
security risks, a ban o
n Huawei would 
be 
a severe blow to China™s geopolitical 
ambitions. Recently, 
both
 the US and China 
have been 
test
ing
 whether they can 
capitali
se politically 
on their technolog
ical 
leadership. Most prominently, the US 

administration 
has issued an executive 
order that not only ban
s Huawei from the 
US mobile infrastructure market

also 
include
s the Chinese tech giant 
on 
an

86
  This confrontation has the potential to 
reach far beyond the PRC and the US. For 
example, in the weeks after the US issued 
its entity list, 
a discuss
ion followed on 
whether it covered ﬁonlyﬂ direct US 

business with China or all trade 
using 
technology based on US patents. If the 

second interpretation prevails, even 

European suppliers such as ARM 
could be 
forced to cease trad
ing
 technology 
based 
on US patents 
with Huawe
i. ARM™s semi
-conductors are a crucial component of chips 
produced by Hisilicon, a company 
that is 
fully owned by Huawei.
87
 In reaction, 
Huawei is 
aiming
 to develop
 more 
indigenous technology. 
Unless 
China and 
the US reverse their current 
policy
 trajectorie
s, we will witness the 
development of two distinct supply chains 
with little if any overlap, 
or
 a process of 
technological decoupling 
that will
 split the 
world into two spheres of technological 

influence. At its 
most 
extreme, this could 
even 
involve
 the lo
ss of technological 
interoperability and 
the introduction of 
two 
different sets of technology standards, 

although this scenario 
seems 
rather 
unlikely. Currently, both the US and China 

have adopted a tactic 
of 
combining carrots 
and sticks to win over third 
markets and

. draw them into their respective sphere
s of 
technological influence. At the core of this 
competition over third markets are the 
EU member states
.  
A ban o
n Huawei (and potentially 
also 
other 
Chinese suppliers) from the European 
market would further fuel this tendency 
for 
a geographical split into two spheres of 
technological influence. Most crucially, 

however, this struggle has direct political 

implications since it adopts a new kind of 

geopolitical logic. It is geopolitical since it 
thinks of spheres of influence in 
geographical terms
, prioriti
sing
 relative 
political gains compared to the respective 
competitor over 
an 
absolute 
level of 
economic output. In contrast to traditional 

geopolit
ics, however, China and the US aim 
to control geographic spaces in a 
new and 
very different way. 
It is n
ot military force 
but control over the flow of goods, services 

and data 
that will be 
decisive. In essence, 
both the US and China 
are 
striv
ing
 for 
contro
l over 
the 
technology and 
infrastructure that enables connectivity in 

Europe. Mark Leonard has described this 

trend as the new ﬁconnectivity warsﬂ.

 The US 
is seeking 
to avoid Chinese flow 
control over data in Europe.
  This geopolitical logic 
of 
achiev
ing flow 
control by means of technolog
ical 
dependence plays out in at least three 

dimensions. First, it creates economic 
advantages insofar as Chinese and US 
companies will profit from a new wave of 

the digiti
sation driven by 
AI 
and 5G. 
Corporat
ion
s will be 
able not only to 
sell 
their products
, but 
also to 
gain enormous 
royalt
ies 
for patents.
  However, 
technological decoupling 
also 
comes 
at an 
enormous cost. 
Step
-by-step, 
existing equipment produced in the 
respective other sphere would need to be 
replaced. The replacement of Huawei base 

stations in Germany 
alone 
is estimated to 
cost •
6.4 billion.
90 Limited production 
capacities could delay the 
roll
-out of new 
technology such 
as 5G. Large segments of 
the ICT manufacturing base are located in 
Asia. It is questionable whether 
Œ and
, even 
if so, 
how 
Œ a relocation to the 
west
 would 
be possible
. A
t the very 
least it 
would be
 costly and time
-consuming
, and 
would 
come
 with enormous 
delay
. The exclusion 
of Huawei from the 
roll
-out of 5G in the UK 
could lead to a delay of 18
Œ24 months.
91 The division of the world into two separate 
markets 
would 
reduce
 the
 sales 
opportunities of individual companies to 
ﬁjust
ﬂ half of the world. Excluding
 Chinese 
vendors 
would 
reduce competition, which 
should be expected to increase prices. Extra 
costs would prevent technological 

innovation
, since less fund
ing
 would be 
available for research and development
, and 
the 
market 
for 
innovative technology

would b
e limited to 
just one
 ﬁsphere of tech 
influenceﬂ.
  
Second, technological spheres of influence 
come with political dependencies
 attached
. Given 
how deeply 
5G will penetrate our 
future societies and economies
, this makes 
it critical infrastructure essential for 
production, urban organi
sation, public 
security and reliability of supply. If 
a countr
y depend
s on US or Chinese technology 
exclusively, it could be forced to make 
political concessions. The fear is that the EU 
could 
face
 a situation 
in which 
it simply 
could not 
say no to Chinese demands 
because it is the PRC that delivers the 
continent
™s critical infrastructure. 
  
Another political implication is the increase 

in 
supply chain security 
derived from 
technological decoupl
ing. If only suppliers 
from allied countries manufacturing 
exclusively in allied countries produce 

technology
, this diminishes 
the risk of 
backdoors and spyware 
being 
installed in 
technology.
92 At the same time,
 however, 
banning companies might reduce the 

potential for diversity
, such as in the case of 
5G Radio Access Network technology that is 

essentially only supplied by Huawei, 

Ericsson and Nokia. A ban o
n Huawei would 
leave Europe with only two suppliers.
  
Third, the new dynamic entails a new 
systems co
nfrontation with a US
-led 
democratic model that aims to preserve 
a free market economy 
in 
competi
tion 
with 
an 
autocratic China relying on a state

 state™s 
authority.
93 This aris
es not least from 
the fact that the PRC is perfecting its 
authoritarian control by means of new 
surveillance
 technologies
. The most 
prominent example is the social credit score 

system that not only 
penali
ses 
behavio
ur that is seen as inappropriate from
 the
 CCP™s
 viewpoint
, but 
also 
rewards citizens for 
what the 
CCP 
sees as good behavio
ur.94 In 
many parts of the world, China is not only 
exporting 
such 
technology
, but train
ing
 authoritarian regimes in how to use 
it for 
surveillance purposes. Hence, a digital 
divide would 
lead 
not only to two spheres of 
technology
, but also 
to the use of 
technolog
ical
 applications for political 
purposes.
  China™s tech giants, including Huawei, 
contribute 
to 
and collaborate with the 
party
-state™s authorit
y in this regard. In fact, 
while Huawei should not 
be 
equated with 
the Chinese party
-state
, it remains under its 
tight control
 with strong links to the 
security 
apparatus (see 
above
).   
It is this new geopolitical dynamic that plays 

out in economic gains, political 

dependencies and a systems confrontation 

that has induced speculation 
about 
whether 
we 
are facing 
a tech
 ﬁCold Warﬂ in which 
two spheres of technological influence 
decouple fro
m each other and face
-off 
against 
each other in a new antagonism.
 In 
this context, 
isolating China 
technologically 
will only motivate t
he PRC 
to become 
more 
self
-reliant in its technology
, further 
reducting any potential 
leverage for the 
west.

Hence, 
while a ban o
n Huawei 
would 
not 
significantly 
increase network security
, it 
feeds into the 
geopolitical logic of 
technological decoupling since it would 
substantially
 reduce European reliance on 
the Chinese tech giant. What critics of 
Huawei fear is not ne
twork insecurity but 
technological dependency. 

Interdependence has 
generally 
been 
identified as a stabili
sing force
, not least 
because it 
raises 
the costs of coercion and 
(in 
the extreme) war. Decoupling is certainly 
a worr
ying
 scenario that is already under
 way.
 Europe™s technological dependency on 
China is 
already 
high and the trend is t
o China™s advantage. At the same time, 

however, 
European dependency on US 
technology is 
also 
significant. The EU runs 
the risk of getting sque
ezed between two 
technological superpowers. 
Levels of 
market share and innovation 
provide a good 
estimate 
of 
European dependenc
y.   
Market share. 
Europe largely depends on 
hardware from China and software from the 

US. 
For 
some
 time
 now
, China 
has been 
at 
the core of high
-technology supply chains. 
While
 it compete
d over price for labo
ur-intensive
 production for a long time
, the 
PRC is no longer 
just 
the workbench of the 
world. Technology made in China is 

competing 
on 
quality
. Factories in the PRC 
do not 
just 
manufacture for US, Japanese 
and Korean brands
. Chinese companies 
are

ing

China™s investments in R&D pay off. One 
crucial indicator is 
its 
share of patented 
technology that is necessary to 
meet 
global 
5G standards, known as standard
-essential 
patents (SEPs). It is 
highly 
complex to 
calculate SEPs and data 
can 
differ 
significantly
 at times
.105
 While some (such 
as IPlytics) calculate that China is already 

leading 
in 
5G SEPs as a result of having 
subm
itted the most
, and particularly 
important
, contributions to the 
standardization process in 3GPP,
106
 others 
regard European
s slightly ahead of
 Chinese 
vendors.
107
 Whatever figures will turn out to 
be correct, 
China™s share of SEPs is 
not only 
significant
, but 
rapidly increasing.
  
Many patents are still registered in the EU, 

but the share 
owned by 
European 
companies is decreasing. In 2008, 2,693 

patents related to telecommunications and 

connectivity were filed in the EU
, of which 
only 116 were filed by Chinese f
irms. 
By 
2017, this number ha
d increased 12
-fold to 
1,478 out of 3,717 patents. This 
is 
an

China will 
remain 
committed to the goals 
behind the initiative. Potentially, this has 
far
-reaching implications even fo
r market 
segments in which European vendors are

Ericsson and Nokia share the global

the next decade
, however, 
Huawei could 
squeeze out both European vendors if 
nothing is

equipment quality from Ericsson and/or

from the Chinese state. In developing

appears to have 
become
 not the only
, but 
possibly
 the most 
important battleground. At first glance

might appear 
that this put

favo

 and gives it 
considerable
 leverage. 
For two reasons
, however, 
Europe is 
actually 
in a rather weak 
position. First, given its enormous 
dependence on technology from both the 

US and China
, Europe is technologically 
vulnerabl
e. Second, the EU runs the risk of 
fragmentation. It is a good sign that EU 

member states have delegated 
the 
process 
of coordination to the European 
Commission. However, despite joint efforts 
on 
a coordinated risk assessment that could 
result in similar re
sponses to the current 
situation, significant differences 
remain
. Poland and the Czech Republic

example, 
seem to be 
the 
most willing to 
follow the US position 
on

France and Italy are about to adopt policies 
that

technical 
criteria that 
could lead to 
a partial ban o

-making 
procedure that allows political leaders 
the 
ultimate deci
sion
.112  
Caught 
up in
 technological dependency and 
internal fragmentation
, what should
 the EU 
do?
 Three different options are 
being 
discussed
 in the current debate
. The first 
is 
for Europe to side with the US, effectively 

ban
ning
 Huawei and build
ing
 on the 
transatlantic partnership, not least 
because
 of the established transatlantic security 
alliance.
 The second option combines non
-discriminatory criteria that help to exclude 
non
-European vendors
, not
 only Chinese 
but also
 other
 Œ such as 
US 
Œ suppliers 
wherever technologically 
achievable
. Such 
techno
log
ical
 protectionism would need to 
be combined with the development of an 
indigenous European technology industry. 
This approach ultimately aims for European 
strategic autonomy
 or ﬁEuropean 
sovereigntyﬂ
.113 The third option is no 
change
 of policy
, which pre
serv
es 
the 
openness of the 
European market, 
and 
inevitably 
results in 
a further increase 
in 
Huawei™s market share and 
extended 
dependency on China. This option 
is also
 likely 
to 
see a gradual deterioration 
in 
the 
transatlantic partnership.
  While we are most sympathetic to the 
second option, we regard all three as 

essentially 
suboptimal
. Options 1 and 2 
adopt a geopolitical logic of isolation
ism
 from 
either 
one or both great powers and

, fuel
ling great power 
competition and 
Œ at wor
st 
Œ the emergence 
of a new Cold War. Option 3, in turn, aims 
simply 
to ignore 
the ongoing geopolitical 
turn in international affairs, which appears 

naïve. Given Europe™s close security alliance 

with the US
, it is questionable whether the 
third option is f
easible. 
Even if it 
were
, however, 
Europe could end up being 
squeezed between the two great powers 

with little room 
for 
man
oeuv
re.   
Against 
a backdrop of these weaknesses
, this paper 
ends with a 
present
ation of 
a preliminary idea 
for 
a fourth option, which 
has 
similarities with option 2 but contains a 
crucial and markedly different aspect. We 

call 
this option ﬁstrategic accessﬂ.
 The 
strategic access option starts from the 

assumption that Europe has an interest in 

preventing isolation and
 decoupling, 
seeks 
to reject the geopolitical turn to prevent a 

new Cold War
, but needs to 
be realistic
. It 
contains 
a combination of and balance 
between two elements: diversification and 

light protectionism.
  
In this paper, we can only outline the basic 
underlying idea and need to leave open 
important details of its implementation. 

The
 aim 
is 
to stimulate debate on this 
subject 
rather than
 offering comprehensive 
practical solutions at this point 
in 
the 
discussi
on. 
To implement the agenda we 
propose
 will require extensive discussion 
and creativity
, ranging from digital free 
trade arrangements through competition 

law to 
minimum
 locali
sation requirements 
and a wide range of other means.

ed 
to address not just 
the 
details
, but the fundamentals of such an 
approach
, and 
it will
 profit from discussion 
beyond Europe
, including
 with
 China and 
the US.
114 Crucially, 
however
, while we 
have 
develop
ed the idea of strategic access in 
relation to th
e current debate over Huawei™s 
inclusion in the 
roll
-out 
of 
the 
mobile 
network infrastructure 
for 
5G, it is an idea 
that aims to address a broader set of 
technological dependencies and 

vulnerabilities of the EU. 
  
Diversification
 In sharp contrast to all three options 
discussed above, strategic access aims to 
preserve an international environment that 

is as open and inclusive as possible without 

running the risk of strong dependencies. In 

order to achieve this goal, diversification
 of 
supply chain
s will be 
of crucial importance. 
The current rise of geopolitics is about the 

US and China 
attempting
 to squeeze out 
the most political capital from threatening 
to cut off 
external actors 
from the supply of 
core resources (e.g. rare earths)
 and 
technologies (e.g. semi
-conductors). A 
response that follows the logic of open and 
free trade could 
therefore
 respond to this 
tactic by diversif
ying 
supply chains.
  Diversification of supply chain
s combines 
two dimensions. First, Europe should import 

technology and raw materials from as many 
different suppliers from as many different 
countries as possible. Second, Europe 
should avoid dependency on technology 

that 
relies 
on patents from one country in 
order to avoid being dragged into 
the 
patent wars th
at loom behind Trump™s 

entity list. Preferential treatment should, for

China's Unfair Policies and Practices in Through 
example, be 
granted 
to technology 
developed from open source
s.  This strategy of diversification should be 
combined with the 
use 
of all available 
means under WTO law to preserve free 
trade and fair competition. Even in fields 
where European companies are strong, it 
faces competition from state
-backed 
companies such as ZTE or Huawei. Hence, 

the EU needs to weigh 
the 
options available
 under international trade law to address 
the 
challenges arising from dumping and 
subsidies. The US could be a natural partner 
in 
these 
attempt
s.115 On patents, in turn, the 
EU faces pressure from both the US and 
China 
to reduce
 royalty fees. A fair patent 
policy and the effective enforcement of 
Intellectual Property Rights (
IPR
) will be 
crucial 
for 
innovative companies such as 
Ericsson and Nokia.
  
Hence, strategic access does not start from 

the idea 
of 
lock
ing 
into 
the digital sphere of 
either 
China or the US. 
Nor
 does 
it 
adopt an 
ideal of self
-reliance and autarky in the 
digital sphere 
Œ a goal that 
would be 
unrealistic for Europe. However, the 

perspective acknowledges the geopolitical 
risks of current development
s and aims to 
respond
 by emphas
ising the diversification 
of supply chains.
  At the same time, diversification requires 
substantial political 
intervention 
in the 
economic sphere. While European 
policymakers cannot and should not 
make 
decisions 
about 
suppliers for corporations, 
they shoul
d provide the necessary 
incentives for diversification
, such as free 
trade agreements on digital issues.

Protectionism light
 While diversification should be at the heart 
of the European approach and prioriti
sed 
wherever possible, it is unlikely 
that
 the 
emergence of strategic dependencies
 can 
be completely avoided
. Hence, 
diversification
 will 
need to be combined 
with a slim
med down
 version of 
protectionism that helps defend existing 
and develop new strategic sectors of the 
European digital industry. Protectionism 

should be avoided wherever possible
; it 
should be 
a ﬁlast resortﬂ
, which 
is w
hy we 
speak of ﬁprotectionism lightﬂ.
  
In some niches, the digital industry 
in 
the 
EU remains strong, mostly in highly 

speciali
sed fields of application driven by 
small and medium
-sized
 enterprises. 
One 
exception is mobile infrastructure in general 

and RAN
 technology in particular
, where
 Ericsson and Nokia hold significant market 
shares. Experts fear, however, that the fact 
that Huawei receives 
so much 
support 
from

 how to preserve the market presence of the 

two European tech companies.
  
Most sensitive is the question 
of 
how to 
support and develop indigenous IT 

manufacturing in Europe. The European I
T industry is mostly underdeveloped and is 
unlikely to flourish 
unless it
 receive
s some 
degree of protection. There is no European 
version of Google, Microsoft, Apple, 

Huawei, Alibaba or Tencent. 
If Europe 
wants to facilitate the rise of a tech giant
, it 
will need to think about preferential 
treatment similar to the development of 
Airbus in aviation.
  Europe needs to address its industrial 

weakness but also 
to 
take action to preserve 
its influence 
on 
regulation and standard 
setting. A positive example of Eu
rope™s 
influence is the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR)
, which has become 
a benchmark for global data protection even 
if 
it is 
not fully enforced 
by 
either 
European 
or non
-European actors. The regulatory 
relevance of the EU relies on its market size. 

Hence, if the EU wants to continue 
to 
influenc
e global rule
-making in the digital 
sphere, it needs to deepen its integration 

and develop 
its 
Digital Single Market. Some 
standards, particularly technical 
standardi
sation, are based on technolog
ical
 leadership. The EU needs to increase its 

support for research and development, not 
least in basic research that is 
less 
commercially profitable in the short
 term.
 Above 
all, Europ
e needs to coordinate and 
cooperate 
more closely 
on the development 
of its digital economy
, including both 
diversification and protectionism light.

 Conclusion
  Under the pretext of network (in
-)security, 
Europe is discussing the 
roll
-out of 5G 
networks throughout the continent. At the 
core of the discussion is the 
controversial 
role of Chinese vendors in general and the 
Chinese tech
-giant Huawei in particular.
  The security of Europe™s 5G network is 
undoubtedly 
crucial. Technological 
innovation, particularly a new virtuali
sed 
core network, network slicing and more 
edge computing, 
will enable 
a wide range of 
applications of next generation mobile 
networks. Ultra
-low latency and massive 
machine
-to-machine communication will 
revolutioni
se the 
econom
y and 
society
. 5G 
will be omnipresent
, running not just future 
ﬁsmart citiesﬂ, autonomous vehicles and 
the 
health sector
, but also production (industrial 
IoT). In short, 5G networks are truly critical 
infrastructure and demand all our efforts to 
make them as secure as possible.
  The ongoing debate in Europe mainly 
focuses on two risks to network security: 

sabotage and espionage. The fear is that 

the inclusion of Huawei technology in 5G
-critical infrastructure could allow China
 to 
conduct
 industria
l and political espionage 
and even provide the authoritarian regime 

in Beijing 
with 
opportunit
ies
 to shut down 
the 
5G network or threaten Europe with 
such a scenario. These are real and serious 

risks. Sabotage and espionage are 

technically feasible and Hua
wei 
is 
hardly 
in a 
position to 
reject orders from the ruling 
Chinese Communist Party.
  
We argue, however, that the proposed 
solution 
of 
ban
ning
 Huawei does not 
address network security
, but rather geo
-economic challenges 
that arise 
from 
dependency
. If Euro
pe is serious about 
                                        
                           
 https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2
019/oct/28/europe
-5g-network
-technology
. addressing sabotage and espionage, a ban 
on Huawei 
would
 indeed increas
e security 
but 
is not the most effective means to 
mitigate the risks. Encryption is the best 
protection against espionage. Network 
redundancies and diversity of vendors, in 

turn, 
would be 
most effective
 reduc
ing
 the 
risk of a kill switch. After all, there is no 
such 
thin
g as 
complete 
network security
, and 
attacking critical infrastructure 
can only be 
made 
more complicated and more costly.
  
Instead of increasing network security, the 
proposed ban o
n Huawei follows a very 
different 
logic
: the logic of 
the 
increasing 
geopolitical tensions over technology. 
China™s B
elt and Road Initiative 
is a major 
infrastructure policy that aims not just to 

build physical and 
Œ even more important
ly Œ digital infrastructure
, but to control the 
flow of goods, services and data. Third 
countries, first and foremost Europe, 
become the primary target of this rising 
technolog
ical
 confrontation between the 
US and China
, and
 Europe faces the risk 
of 
further increas
ing
 its technological 
dependency.
  The current situation 
demonstrates 
Europe™s v
ulnerability. Europe 
is 
heavily 
reli
ant 
on software from the US and 
hardware from China. This 
has 
contribute
d to an internal fragmentation among EU 
member states in their responses to the 
current situation. In order to

no policy change, which 
benefits China.
  We reject all three options and

 out
 a fourth alternative that we refer to as 
strategic access. S

 30 combines two aspects: diversification and 
light protectionism. Diversification is the 

most crucial componen
t, aiming for 
a diversification of supply in order to avoid 
dependency on manufacturing 
and the
 underlying patents that could be utili
sed in a 
state
-run 
patent war. It also implies 
consider
ation of using the 
legal means 
available 
under WTO law 
to 
address 
issues 
of subsidies and fair competition
, as well as 
effective implementation of a fair patent 
policy and IPR enforcement.
  Protectionism light, in turn, should only 
be 
appl
ied
 where the diversification strategy 
has 
fail
ed. It includes defending 
the 
existi
ng 
European digital industry where it runs the 
risk of suffering from unfair Chinese 
competition resulting from the state
-permeated character of the Chinese 
economy. It further entails 
a limited and 
strategically targeted industrial policy to 
strengthen th
e EU™s industrial base in core 
technological fields of digiti
sation by a 
variety of means 
from 
R&D support 
to 
deepening the Digital Single Market.
 While 
we discuss this approach in the context of 

the ongoing 5G infrastructure debate
, we 
believe 
that 
it add
resses 
the 
wider 
phenomenon of technological rivalry that 
can be expected
 continue beyond 5G
 in the 
future
