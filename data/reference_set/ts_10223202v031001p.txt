Introduction 
The present document describes what information is required 
for the handover of intercepted IP-based messaging traffic 
from a Communications Service Provider to an LEMF. The present document covers a stage 2 description of the data, 
but does not specify any functionality within the scope of ETSI TS 102 232-1 [3]. 
The Recommendation ITU-T I.130 [6] method for characterizing 
a service will be used as a general framework for the 
present document. The modified concept of a "stage 1" will 
be called the "attributes" of the interface. The attributes of 
the interface are the sum total of the en
tire constituent attributes that an 
interface may need to communicate. The 
modified concept of a "stage 2" will be called the "events" of the interface. The events of the interface define the rules 
of the relationships between the attributes that are required to arrange the disjoint attributes into meaningful information 
for a messaging service interaction. 
The present document is intended to be general enough to be used in a variety of messaging services. It should be 
recognized that a side effect of this approach is some IRI fi
elds identified may be difficult to extract or non-existent 
depending on the messaging service being intercepted. In such
 cases it may be completely reasonable that the delivered 
IRI contain empty fields or fields with the value 0. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)7 1 Scope The present document contains a stage 1 like description of 
the interception information in relation to the process of 
sending and receiving asynchronous messages. The present document also contains a stage 2 like description of when 
Intercept Related Information (IRI) and Content of Communication (CC) need to be sent, and what information it needs 

to contain. 
It is recognized that "Instant Messenger" and "Chat" app
lications are another way of exchanging electronic text 
messages. While the present document may be applicable to 
such applications it is in no way a goal of the present 
document to address these methods of electronic text messaging. 

The definition of handover transport and encoding of HI2 and HI3 is outside the scope of the present document. Refer 
to ETSI TS 102 232-1 [3]. 
The present document is designed to be used where appropriate in conjunction with other deliverables that define the 
service specific IRI data formats. The present document aligns with 3GPP TS 33.108 [5], ETSI TS 101 671 [4], ETSI 
TS 101 331 [1] and ETSI TR 101 944 [i.1].

-08)11 4 General 
4.1 E-mail services 
E-mail services are those services which offer the capability to transmit or receive ARPANET text messages. The 
following description is taken from IETF RFC 5322 [7]: 
"In this context, messages are viewed 
as having an envelope and contents. The en
velope contains whatever information 
is needed to accomplish transmission and delivery. The contents compose the object to be delivered to the recipient". 
E-mail service, in general, can be divided into two categor
ies: those services which allow a computer to transfer a 
message to another computer; and those services which allow us
ers to manipulate their mailbox by doing such things as 
downloading messages from the mailbox and deleting messages from the mailbox. Both of these categories of E-mail 
services can be of interest to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and are therefore within the scope of the present 
document. 
NOTE: When using IP-packet delivery, control level packet
s that are associated with the targeted E-mail may be 
delivered as content. Control level p
ackets are those packets that are used by the E-mail transfer protocol 
to set-up the E-mail communication and to termin
ate the E-mail communication and are outside of the 
traditional IETF RFC 5322 [7] formatted E-mail. This al
lows for different interception solutions without 
burdening the Mediation Function (MF) with the responsibility of "cleaning" up said differences in input. 
4.2 Unified messaging 
Unified Messaging
 (UM) is the integration of different electronic me
ssaging and communications media (e-mail, SMS, 
Fax, voicemail, video messaging, etc.) technologies into a single interface, accessible from a variety of different 

devices. A "voicemail only" system without capability for fax, 
video, etc. is still regarded as an UM system in the 
present document. 
For the purpose of lawful interception, a target's UM service 
might be intercepted as part of a "network intercept". This 
is for example the case when the target accesses his UM box from his own mobile terminal. In that case handover is 
covered by 3GPP TS 33.108 [5]. However if the target accesses
 his mailbox from a public terminal (using a PIN code), 
the access event is in the scope of the present document. The same applies for additional UM services that might be 

offered by a CSP, such as e-mail notifications, SMS notifications, the ability to change a greeting message or PIN using 

a web interface. 
While e-mail services can be considered part of UM, for handover of intercepted e-mail a CSP shall use the EmailCC 
and EmailIRI structures. Subject to national agreement, this requirement may be over-ridden and the handover of 
intercepted e-mail may use the MessagingIRI and MessagingCC or MessagingMMCC structures.

5.1 Reference network topology 
The network topology shown in figure 1 is intended to represent the many relationships that may exist between the 

entities involved in E-mail communications. Actual scenarios using this diagram are enumerated in clause 5.2. The 
following should be considered when viewing figure 1: 
• The term "Mail Server" is used to represent a logical entity that relays mail for its mail clients, receives and 

(temporarily) stores mail for its mail clients, and allows
 mail clients access to the aforementioned stored mail 
and the ability to delete it from the mail server. 
• The term "Mail Client" is used to represent a logical entity that either injects mail into the network or removes 
mail from the network or reads mail from the network. 
• Mail Client and Mail Server numbers are used to indicate what entities share a client-server relationship, so 
Mail Client1 is a client of Mail Server1, etc.

5.2 Reference scenarios 
5.2.1 E-mail send failure 
It may occur that E-mails sent into the Internet do not r
each their intended target. The most common reason for this 
would seem to be a mistaken E-mail address, but could al
so be problems contacting the receiving mail server or other 
server issues. Note that a failure reply message is not always generated and if a failure reply message is generated, it is 
generated by the Mail Server that first experiences problems transferring the mail message. 
a) Client3a sends an E-mail to 
nobody@MailServer4.com
 and gives the E-mail to the clients' server, Mail 
Server3. 
b) Mail Server3 fills in part of the E-mail envelope and routes the E-mail to Mail Server4. 
c) Mail Server4 replies to Mail Server3 that the recipient is unknown. 
d) Mail Server3 creates a "reply" message to Mail Client3a stating that the recipient was unknown, and either 

pushes that message to the client or stores it in the clients' mailbox for later retrieval.

5.2.2 E-mail send success 
This scenario represents what is likely to be the most common case of an E-mail send. While it is unclear how many 
E-mails go directly from a client's E-mail server to the destination E-mail server, it is clear that routing of E-mails 
through Mail Transfer Agents (MTA) is not uncommon and as su
ch is the scenario represented here. The direct routing 
scenario is a subset where the middle mail server is removed. Note also that the client sending the E-mail is not on the 
same administrative network as its mail server. 
a) Client1 sends an E-mail to 
client3b@MailServer3.com
 and gives the E-mail to the clients' server, Mail 
Server1. 
b) Mail Server1 fills in part of the E-mail envelope and forwards the mail to Mail Server4 for forwarding. 
c) Mail Server4 attaches its information to the E-mail envelope and forwards the mail to Mail Server3. 
d) Mail Server3 either pushes the message to the Mail Client3b or stores it in the clients' mailbox for later 

retrieval.

5.2.3 E-mail download detail 
This scenario enumerates the processes that shall take place 
in any E-mail download process. It is assumed that some 
set of E-mail is already resident on the Mail Server3 in the mailbox for Mail Client3a. 
a) Mail Client3a sends login credentials. This may take several messages or may be accomplished in a single 
message depending on the mailbox access protocol. What is 
protocol invariant is that this login process will 
contain some form of authentication process. 
b) Mail Server3 sends an "authentication success" message to
 indicate to the client that the login process is 
complete. At this stage Mail Server3 may push down mailbox state to the client, or may wait for the client to 

request mailbox state. Using POP3, however, Mail Server3 will not push down messages until they have been 

explicitly requested by the client. 
c) Mail Client3a may request a message or a set of messages to be downloaded, however this step may be 
bypassed in some protocols. 
d) Mail Server3 downloads the requested messages to Mail Client3a. 
e) After the mail has been downloaded the server may delete the message as the result of a request.

5.2.4 E-mail send detail 
This scenario enumerates the processes that shall take place in
 any E-mail send process. In the scenario the relationship 
between Mail Server3 and Mail Client3a is such that the mail is first sent to Mail Server3, which then forwards the mail. 
While this process seems universally true it need not be true. Mail Client 3a could send the mail to the terminating mail 
server. 
a) Mail Client3a sends introduction. This may take several messages or may be accomplished in a single message 
depending on the mailbox access protocol. The authentication features and capabilities is protocol dependent 

and authentication may be used in some protocols and not in others. 
b) Mail Server3 sends a "login success" message to indicate to the client that the login process is complete. 
c) Mail Client3a initiates a send by including the sender E-mail address, the list of recipient E-mail addresses, 
and the text body of the message. 
d) Mail Server3 sends a response indicating that the mail 
has been successfully received. At this point Mail 
Server3 begins the process of determining the correct mail servers for each of the recipients, updating the mail 
text to include information in the envelope, and forwarding the mail.

6 E-mail events 
6.1 Introduction 
This clause contains the high level definition of the content and the IRI messages associated with different E-mail 
communication "events". An "E-mail communication event" is a way of expressing different points in an E-mail 
transfer where a target may become active. All E-mail communication events are represented by one or more IRI 
records and potentially content. Clause 6 does not specify
 how the information is encoded but specifies what 
information shall be encoded. 
This clause only lays out which fields shall be present in each event and what requirement is fulfilled by the field. The 
definition of each field is either in another document or in clause 7. 
6.2 E-mail send event 
6.2.1 Introduction 
The E-mail send event is represented in clauses 5.2.2 and 5.2.4. This event is represented by a set of IRI and content 

associated with an E-mail being sent by a target. Each E-mail sent during a session between an E-mail client and an 

E-mail server shall be considered a separate E-mail send event. 
There is currently no IRI specified specifically for E-mail send "attempts", and no indication of E-mail send "success" 
or "failure". E-mail failures often occur a few servers down from where the initial E-mail is sent, and notification of said 
failure is optional and difficult to automatically correlate when it does occur. 
This set of IRI fulfils requirement [E.1.1]. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)17 6.2.2 E-mail send captured content 
The target may have been matched for an E-mail send by the E-mail address of the sender, login name of the sender, or 
the IP address. Due to the wide array of intercept options and possible E-mail protocols the captured content maybe just 
the equivalent of the IETF RFC 5322 [7] E-mail envelope and text or, at the other extreme, the captured content may be 

the whole E-mail session. What shall be present is the IETF RFC 5322 [7] E-mail envelope and text for E-mails sent by 

the target. 
This clause fulfils requirements [E.2.1] and [E.2.2]. 
6.2.3 E-mail send IRI 
The following information may be present in E-mail Send IRI. The availability of this information will depend on the 
implementation and national regulations.

 Note that in this case, both Octets Sent fields are indicat
ors of the amount of communication occurring. Due, however, 
to differing laws and interception capabilities it is not specified exactly what these byte counts are, only that they 
accurately represent the amount of information being transferred by the target. That is to say, these byte counts cannot 
be the byte count of an entire E-mail session in which many E-mails are sent but only one of those E-mails was sent by 
the target entity as the numbers would no longer be representative of the amount of information being transferred by the 

target. Similarly these byte counts cannot be taken to be a one-to-one match of the number of bytes in an E-mail as they 

may include the control traffic to set-up the E-mail or may include some filing system overhead. 
Finally it is worth noting that if the intercept capability is not done based on a protocol but instead based on information 
on a file system, the Server Octets Sent could be 0 if that accurately represents that the server sent little or no 
information back to the client. 
In case authenticated SMTP, as defined in IETF RFC 4954 [13], is used, the AAAInformation contains the username, 
the authentication method, the challenge and response string and the result. As defined in requirements [E.1.13] and 

[E.2.3], this information shall be available in the case of
 application layer interception.
 In the case of IP packet 
interception, it shall be sent as part of HI3 in IP packet format, in which case there is no explicit mapping onto an 
ASN.1 structure. 
6.3 E-mail receive event 
6.3.1 Introduction 
The E-mail receive event is best represented in clause 5.2.3 and represents a set of IRI and content associated with an 
E-mail being received by a target mailbox. Each E-mail received during a session between an E-mail client and an 
E-mail server shall be considered a separate E-mail receive event. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)18 There is currently no IRI defined for E-mail receive "attempts", and no indication of E-mail receive "success" or 
"failure". The reason for this decision is because it is deemed an excessive burden on all the parties involved in an 

intercept for the amount of information that can be obtained. 
This set of IRI fulfils requirement [E.1.2]. 
6.3.2 E-mail receive captured content 
The target may have been matched for an E-mail receive by the E-mail address of the recipient, login name of the 
recipient, or the IP address of the client. Due to the wide array of intercept options and possible E-mail protocols the 

captured content maybe just the equivalent of the IETF RFC 5322 [7] E-mail envelope and text, or, at the other extreme, 
the captured content may be the whole E-mail session. What shall be present is the IETF RFC 5322 [7] E-mail envelope 
and text for E-mails received by the target. 
This clause fulfils requirements [E.2.1] and [E.2.2]. 
6.3.3 E-mail receive IRI 
The following information may be present in E-mail receive IRI. The availability of this information will depend on the 
implementation and national regulations.

differing laws and interception capabilities it is not specified exactly what these byte counts are, only that they 
accurately represent the amount of information being transferred to the target. For instance, these byte counts may not 
be the byte count of an entire E-mail session in which many E-mails are transferred but only one of those E-mails was 

destined to the target entity. In that case the session byte count would no longer be representative of the amount of 

information being transferred to the target. Similarly these byte counts could not be taken to be a one-to-one match of 

the number of bytes in an E-mail as they may include the cont
rol traffic to set-up the E-mail or may include some filing 
system overhead. 
Finally it is worth noting that if the intercept capability is not done based on a protocol but instead based on information 
on a file system, the Client Octets Sent could be 0 if that accurately represents that the client sent little or no information
 back to the server. 
6.4 E-mail download event 
6.4.1 Introduction 
The E-mail Download Event is best represented in clause 5.2.3 and represents a set of IRI and content associated with 

an E-mail being downloaded from a target mailbox. Each E-ma
il downloaded during a session between an E-mail client 
and an E-mail server shall be considered a separate E-ma
il Download Event. In the case where not the full E-mail 

content is downloaded by the user, but just the header and some
 lines at the top of the E-mail, this shall be signalled by 
using the "E-mail partial download" event instead of the regular "E-mail download" event. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)19 There is currently no IRI defined for E-mail download "attempt
s". The reason for this decision is because it is deemed 
an excessive burden on all the parties involved in an inte
rcept for the amount of information that can be obtained. 
This set of IRI fulfils requirement [E.1.2]. 
6.4.2 E-mail download captured content 
The target may have been matched for an E-mail Download by the E-mail address of the recipient, login name of the 
recipient, or the IP address of the client. Due to the wide array of intercept options and possible E-mail protocols the 

captured content maybe just the equivalent of the IETF RFC 5322 [7] E-mail envelope and text, or, at the other extreme, 

the captured content may be the whole E-mail session. In th
e case of an E-mail partial download, the captured content 
will contain the part of the E-mail that was downloaded by the user. What shall be present is the IETF RFC 5322 [7] 
E-mail envelope and text for E-mails received by the target. 
This clause fulfils requirements [E.2.1] and [E.2.2]. 
6.4.3 E-mail download IRI

the implementation and national regulations.

requirements [E.1.13] and [E.2.3], this information shall be available in the case of application layer interception. In the 

case of IP packet interception, it shall be sent as part of 
HI3 in IP packet format, in which case there is no explicit 
mapping onto an ASN.1 structure. 
7 E-mail attributes 
7.0 Availability of information 
The availability of the information described in this clause will depend on the implementation and national regulations. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)20 7.1 E-mail protocol ID 
This attribute can be used to identify the E-mail application or protocol that was used at the point of interception to 
transfer the E-mail. This should identify which appendix should be looked at for encoding rules. A full enumeration of 
this attribute is provided in annex D, however a brief list should help provide an example for the definition. This 
attribute shall contain values including, but not limited to: 
• SMTP; 
• POP3; 
• IMAP; 
• Webmail. 
NOTE: More information about webmail interception is provided in annex H. 
7.2 E-mail address 
All E-mail address attributes are text strings that indicate an E-mail address in the form that it was intercepted in. E-mail 

addresses may be fully qualified, however many points of interception will not provide fully qualified E-mail addresses. 
The above definition of an E-mail address fulfils requirement [E.1.4]. 
7.3 E-mail recipient list 
This is a list of one or more E-mail address of the intended 
recipients of an E-mail. Note that this list may not be 
complete and only contains those recipient addresses that 
can be intercepted by the interception equipment. SMTP can 
be used as an example, where only a proper sub-set of 
the recipients can be seen within the protocol itself. 
NOTE: The amount of information which can be retrieved from the SMTP protocol depends on the choice of 
where the interception equipmen
t is placed in the network. 
7.4 E-mail sender 
This is a single E-mail address representing the inter
cepted address of the sender of a targeted E-mail. 
7.5 Total recipient count 
This attribute is an integer representing the total number of r
ecipients that the interception equipment noticed, even if all 
those recipients could not be explicitly enumerated in the E-mail Recipient List. 
7.6 Message ID 
This attribute is used, when available, to relay a message identifier with a message. Applications which communicate 
primarily through message IDs may use this attribute to relay this information to the LEMF. When present, this attribute 
and its exact meanings will be highly dependent on the E-mail application and will be specified in the application 
specific appendix. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)21 7.7 Status This attribute identifies the status of the communication with values of UNKNOWN, FAILED, and SUCCESS. 
SUCCESS should be used to indicate status when it is clear
 that the message reached its destination. The destination 
should be thought of as the terminating point of the action. 
Table 4: E-mail events and termination points 
E-mail Event
 Termination Point
 E-mail Send 
Recipient Mailbox Received 
E-mail Download 
Download succeeded 
E mail Partial Download Partial Download succeeded 
E-mail Receive 
Recipient Mailbox Received 
 When the termination point is not understood by the intercept equipment, or the termination point is not monitored by 
the intercept equipment and the application operation was not determined to be a failure, then the value of UNKNOWN 

should be used to indicate status. 
When the application operation was determined to be a failure (i
.e. an error code or some other means) then the value of 
FAILED should be used to indicate status. 
7.8 Server and client port 
These attributes identify the Layer 4 port used for communi
cation of the E-mail. How the "server" and the "client" are 
distinguished is identified in the appendices on a per E-mail application basis. 
7.9 Server and client octets sent 
These attributes indicate the number of octets sent by the 
client and server during the communication of the E-mail. 
How the "server" and the "client" are distinguished is identified
 in the appendices on a per E-mail application basis. As 
specified above, both of the octet sent numbers need only accurately represent the amount of information being 

transferred and should not be considered exact counts of bytes sent at any particular protocol layer. 
7.10 AAAInformation 
This structure contains the various attributes related to authentication in either the POP3, IMAP4 or SMTP protocol. 

Whether the values may be present is depending on national legislation. 
8 Unified Messaging events 
8.0 Generic description 
UM events that happen after invocation of the intercept shall be signalled using the MessagingCC and MessagingIRI 

ASN.1. If the Messaging events are created/formatted for LEA delivery by an LI mediation system, the 

original-message element in the MessagingIRI may, up to agreement between CSP and LEA, contain the "raw" IRI 

event as generated by the UM system. The event generated by the UM system shall be translated onto an event defined 
in the MessagingIRI. If no translation is possible, the LEA can use the raw event for analysis. The box-identifier can be 
used to uniquely identify a message box in the case where multiple boxes are under intercept within the same LIID. The 

system-identifier element identifies the specific system that 
generated the event. The exchange of information regarding 
the systems and raw event documentation is up to bilateral agreement between CSP and LEA and is outside the scope of 

the present document. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)22 The status of the current operation can be signalled using the Messaging-Status: 
• unknown: 
it is unknown what the status is (e.g. a raw event was formatted and the mediation function was unable to 

interpret its status); 
• not-applicable: 

a status is not applicable for the event because it 
is implicit (e.g. a login event, mailbox lock); 
• operation-failed: 

the operation failed (for example a refused login); 
• operation-succeeded: 

the operation succeeded (for example a voicemail message was successfully deleted); 
• operation-cancelled: 
the user cancelled the operation in progress (for example a target only listens to part of a voicemail message); 
• operation-started: 
the operation was started but its outcome is still unknown (for example a message deposit was started); 
• operation-lost: 

the operation was started but its outcome was lost (for example: the mediator lost track of the operation). 
8.1 Delivery of CC 
A number of UM events shall trigger delivery of CC. This can for example be the UM message deposited or the 

greeting message that was deposited or changed. Table 5 indicates which events shall trigger CC. 
Table 5: Unified Messaging events that shall trigger CC delivery 
Structure Element (event)
 Messaging-Event deposit 
Messaging-Event retrieve 
Messaging-Event delete 
Messaging-Event save 
Messaging-Event calendar 
Messaging-Event contact 
Messaging-Box-Event greeting-record 
Messaging-Box-Event greeting-change 
Messaging-Box-Event greeting-delete

Messaging-Notification-Event email 
Messaging-Notification-Event fax-to-email 
Messaging-Notification-Event mms 
Messaging-Notification-Event generic 
Messaging-Property-Notification-Type voice-to-text 
 A CIN shall be created for each logical sequence of UM events. An example of a logical sequence is a target that logs in 
to the UM box until he logs out. All intermediate events (e.g. message retrieve, message delete, greeting change) shall 
have the same CIN. When both IRI and CC is sent, the event-identifier element shall be used to uniquely identify the 

event within the same CIN. This helps the LEA to correlate the events (a target could for example retrieve three 

messages in the same session). If one event delivers multiple parts of CC (e.g. text and graphics) the content-identifier 

can be used to identify the unique content 
streams within the same event-identifier. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)23 Depending on the type of CC content, either the MessagingCC or MessagingMMCC payloads may be used. The 
MessagingMMCC payload may be used when the signalling capabilities from ETSI TS 102 232-5 [38] are required. 

Otherwise, the MessagingCC payload may be used. 
The sequence-number parameter may be used to chunk the MessagingCC in smaller pieces of content, in a scenario 
where the CC is streamed and buffering is not desirable. Numbering shall start at 0. The last piece of MessagingCC 

shall in that case be signalled with the end-of-sequence parameter. If sequence-numbering is not used, the content 
parameter shall contain all data. The type of content in the MessagingCC is signalled using the content-type element 
which shall contain the mime-type as defined in IETF RFC 2045 [20] and IETF RFC 2046 [21]. The encoding 

mechanism used on the data within the content element in the MessagingCC may be specified using values defined in 

IETF RFC 2045 [20] in the content-transfer-encoding element. 
A common use case is the delivery of a set of RTP streams that contains the call legs between the user and the UM-
system. The RTP streams start once a user connects to the UM
-system. Therefore, the RTP legs should be correlated to 
the HI2 'connect' event. Table 6 describes the MessagingCC signalling required for the separate CC RTP streams. 
Alternatively, when detailed signalling information is available, the MessagingCC payload may be used.

 The content of an SMS message delivered by the UM-system 
shall be signalled as MessagingCC with a content-type of 
'text/plain' and an optional character encoding. 
NOTE 1: It is possible that one UM event can result in mul
tiple IRI/CC deliveries, for example if the target receives 
an SMS and e-mail notification at the same time. 
NOTE 2: If a target's mobile terminal and UM box are both intercepted, it is very likely that duplicate delivery will 
take place when the target accesses his own message box. As the intercepted material originates from 
different systems, the CSP may not be able to correlate these different streams. As a countermeasure, up 
to agreement between CSP and LEA, it may be decided not to deliver CC from the UM system when the 

target accesses his own message box. 
The content of an iCalendar message delivered shall be signalled as MessagingCC. Refer to IETF RFC 5545 [39] for 

MIME-type and content-type encoding and IETF RFC 4791 [41] for detail of the formatting and properties of the 

iCalendar messages. 
The content of an Address Book/Contact message delivered shall be signalled as MessagingCC. Refer to IETF 
RFC 6350 [40] for MIME-type and content-type encoding and IETF RFC 6352 [42] for detail of the formatting and 

properties of the vCard messages. 
8.2 Messaging events 
The Messaging-Event structure is used to indicate that a message is manipulated within the UM system. The following 

events can be signalled: 
• deposit: 

a message is delivered to the target's UM box; 
• retrieve: 

a message is retrieved by the target; 
• delete: 

a message is deleted by the target; 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)24 • save: 
a message is saved by the target; 
• slamdown: 

deposit of a message is aborted (caller "slams down" before speaking); 
• calendar: 
a calendar event is sent to or from the target; 
• contact: 
a contact record is sent to or from the target. 
8.3 Messaging box events 
The Messaging-Box-Event structure is used to signal operations on the target's message box. The following events can 

be signalled: 
• unknown: 

an unknown operation occurs to the box; 
• login: 
the target logs in to the box; 
• logout: 
the target logs out from the box; 
• lock: 

the target locks the box; 
• unlock: 

the target unlocks the box; 
• activate: 

a box is activated (for example: the target activates the voicemail service); 
• deactivate: 

a box is deactivated; 
• delete: 

a box is deleted; 
• pin-change: 

the target changes the pin-code of the box; 
• greeting-record: 
the target records a new greeting message; 
• greeting-change: 
the target changes an existing greeting message; 
• greeting-delete: 

the target deletes a greeting message; 
• greeting-enable: 

the target enables a greeting message; 
• greeting-disable: 

the target disables a greeting message; 
• notification-enable: 

the target enables notification in case of new messages; 
• notification-disable: 

the target disables notification in case of new messages; 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)25 • disconnect: 
the target is disconnected from the box without performing a logout; 
• connect: 

a party (either the target or the third party) connects to the messaging system and has not yet performed further 

operations; 
• greeting-play: 
a greeting is played for a party; 
• language-change: 
the target changes his language preference; 
• pin-security-enable: 

the target enables PIN security. Without PIN security, access to a messaging system may be granted by only 
verifying the end-user device. With PIN security, the 
PIN authentication is enfor
ced in every access attempt 
towards the messaging system; 
• pin-security-disable: 
the target disables PIN security; 
• personal-operator-add: 
the target adds the personal operator definition on the box; 
• personal-operator-change: 
the target changes the personal operator definition on the box; 
• personal-operator-remove:

• additional-destination-change: 
the target changes additional delivery destinations on the box; 
• additional-destination-remove: 

the target removes additional delivery destinations from the box; 
auto-play-enable: 

the target enables the playing of message options (such as saving, deleting) after the messaging system has 

played a message while the target is retrieving it; 
auto-play-disable: 

the target disables the auto-play feature; 
header-play-enable: 
the target enables the playing of meta information (such as deposit date) before the message system plays a 
message while the target is retrieving it; 
header-play-disable: 
the target disables the header-play feature. 
8.4 Messaging notification events 
The Messaging-Notification-Event structure is used to signa
l the LEA that a notification was sent to the target. The 
following messages can be signalled: 
• sms: 

an SMS message was sent to the target; 
• sms-deposit: 

the target is notified that a new message is available in the box; 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)26 • sms-slamdown: 
the target is notified that a user disconnected before 
delivering a message to the UM system (for example: user 
disconnects during a voicemail greeting before the "beep"); 
• sms-pin-reminder: 

a reminder message with the PIN of the message box was sent to the target; 
• email: 
an e-mail message was sent to the target; 
• fax-to-email: 
the UM system received a fax message and forwarded it as an e-mail to the target; 
• mms: 

an MMS message was sent to the target; 
• generic: 

a notification was sent to the target. 
8.5 Messaging call events 
The Messaging-Call-Event is used to signal call events related to the messaging system. One event "callout" is currently 

supported to signal the LEA that the target instructed the UM system to set up a call with the sender of a messaging 

event. 
8.6 Signalling of party information 
The generic information to signal the party information related to the messaging event is in the 

Messaging-Party-Information structure. The party-qualifier signa
ls if the party was originating, terminating, associated 
or if it was unknown. The party-identities are described in table 7. The optional party-validity signals whether the CSP 

has assured the party identity. The optional copy-qualifier signals whether the party identity was directly addressed, 
carbon copied or blind carbon copied. 
NOTE 1: The associated party qualifier can be used to si
gnal the association between a party and a specific element 
within the messaging system. A common use case is a user configuring a specific greeting for a limited 
selection of parties. 
NOTE 2: To avoid confusion: the party-validity does not imply that the CSP identified an actual person.

available. IP address may be insufficient if the party is using a NAPT 

based Internet access. 

ip-address-and-port is made of port-nu
mber and of ip-address. They are 
defined in the IETF RFC 6335 [35], and in IETF RFC 791 [31] for IP V4 

and IETF RFC 2460 [34] for IP V6. The important elements are those 

related to the client The elements regarding to the server are useful if the 

UMS is complex, or based on interconnected heterogeneous UMS 
servers, which let exchange of voice or multimedia messages between 
different boxes and different operators, through some NAPT. It will be 

useful to determine if it is a client or server side by using the parameter 

"party-information", and related parameter "Messaging-Party-Qualifier". It 
will be
 easy to determine if the party is originating or is the destination.

SMTP 
A.1 SMTP introduction 
SMTP can generally be viewed as a means for sending E-mail from one computer to another. The computer which sent 
the E-mail may not be the original source of the E-mail, and the computer which received the E-mail may not be the 

ultimate destination. 
Clause A.2 indicates which events can be expected when an interception point is either SMTP or at an SMTP server. 

Clause A.3 indicates which protocol units one could expect to fill the event attributes. 
A.2 SMTP HI2 events 
A.2.1 E-mail login event 
An SMTP login success event should be generated after the SMTP client has sent the SMTP hello message and the 
SMTP server has responded with a response indicating success as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [9]. 
An SMTP login failure event should be generated after the SMTP client has sent the SMTP hello message and the 
SMTP server has responded with a response indicating failure as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [9]. 
NOTE: SMTP logins are not well authenticated. 
A.2.2 E-mail send event 
An SMTP send event should be generated after the SMTP client has sent DATA command and the server has responded 

with a response indicating a successful send as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [9]. 
No event should be generated on an unsuccessful send (for further study). 
A.2.3 E-mail receive event 
An SMTP receive event should be generated after the SMTP client has sent DATA command and the server has 
responded with a response indicating a successful transfer as defined in IETF RFC 5321 [9]. 
No event should be generated on an unsuccessful receive (for further study). 
NOTE: The difference in an E-mail Receive Event and an E-mail Send Event, for SMTP, is a matter of semantics 
but may have legal ramifications.

-08)35 B.5 POP3 HI3 delivery of Content of Communication 
Content of Communication (CC) shall contain the complete data of all POP3 sessions initiated by a target. Sessions 
extend from the AUTHORIZATION state commands until the UPDATE state commands. USER, PASS, APOP and 

QUIT have to be included.  
POP3 provides the possibility to extend individual sessions to reasonable periods of time (the RFC states that an auto 
logoff timer shall be a minimum of 10 minutes and a client may keep the session alive by sending periodic NOOP 

commands), making it impractical to deliver CC only after the 
session is closed. To keep the delay between original 
communication and delivery of CC to an amount acceptable to LEAs, delivery of CC shall be initiated at least after 

every finished POP3 command/response.

IMAP4 C.1 IMAP4 introduction 
IMAP version 4 (IMAP4) IETF RFC 3501 [10] can generally be viewed as a means for remotely manipulating E-mail 
stored on a server in a mailbox and the mailboxes itself. Extending the capabilities of POP3, IMAP4 provides means to 

create, change and delete folders of the mailbox. The APPEND command provides a "send"-like facility. IMAP4 

connections consist of the establishment of a client/server network connection, an initial greeting from the server, and 

client/server interactions. These client/server interactions consist of a client command, server data, and a server 
completion result response. 
The LI-relevant IMAP interactions shall be represented by one or more IRI records. The complete data of all 
interactions shall be delivered as call content if requested. 
Clause C.2 indicates which events can be expected when 
intercepting IMAP4 communication session(s) and provides a 
table mapping the LI-relevant IMAP4 commands to corresponding IRI messages. 

Clause C.3 details the delivery of CC. 
Clause C.4 contains an example of IMAP4 communication session and related LI events. 
C.2 IMAP4 HI2 event-record mapping 
Table C.1 shows the events sent are mapped to the HI2 record type that the event will be sent under. 
Table C.1 details the mapping of LI-relevant IMAP4 commands and corresponding IRI events. For every execution of 
one of the listed commands, an IRI message of the specified type shall be sent to the LEA.

 NOTE 1: The UID command supports the IMAP commands FETCH, COPY and STORE on the message with the 
specified UID. From a LI perspective, only UID FETCH contains IRI relevant information. 
NOTE 2: IETF RFC 3501 [10] IMAP4 states "A non-existent UID is ignored without any error message generated. 
Thus, it is possible for a UID FETCH command to return an OK without any data". In this case, an IRI 
record with E-mail-Status "successful" could be generated even though no message with the specified 

UID exists. 
IRI messages shall be sent directly after the IMAP4 interaction has been completed.

 C.3 IMAP4 HI3 delivery of call content 
The nature of IMAP4 as a message access and mailbox (folder) 
manipulation protocol leads to CC containing not only 
information directly related to E-mails, but additional information also, e.g. folder manipulation and mail status flags. 
Call content (CC) shall contain the complete data of all IMAP4 sessions initiated by a target. Sessions extend from 

LOGIN or AUTHENTICATE to LOGOUT commands. LOGIN, AUTHENTICATE and LOGOUT itself are included. 
IMAP4 provides the possibility to extend individual sessions to long periods of time (theoretically up to weeks), making 
it impractical to deliver CC only after the session is clos
ed. To keep the delay between original communication and 
delivery of CC to an amount acceptable to LEAs, delivery of CC shall be initiated at least after every finished IMAP4 

interaction.

Messaging ASN.1 
The ASN.1 (Recommendation ITU-T X.680 [11]) module that represents the information in the present document and 
meets all stated requirements is shown below. ETSI TR 102 503 [i.2] gives an overview of the relevant Object 

IDentifiers (OID) used in ASN.1 modules of the Lawful Intercept specifications and points to the specification where 
the modules can be found. 
The ASN.1 definitions are in .txt file "EmailPDU,ver16.txt", contained in archive ts_10223202v031001p0.zip which 
accompanies the present document. 
NOTE: The term "EmailPDU" instead of "MessagingPDU" is used for reasons of backwards compatibility.

-08)47 Annex E (informative): 
E-mail LI requirements 
E.1 HI2 requirements 
[E.1.1] The HI2 interface has to support the ability to deliver
 IRI record(s), without delivering the contents of the 
message, when a target has sent E-mail. 
NOTE 1: How an E-mail send is determined and intercepted is outside of the scope of the present document, 
however, that E-mail was sent and to whom it was sent is interesting to law enforcement. Likewise the 
information needed to intercept that an E-mail was sent and to whom it was sent can be determined in 
many ways including, but limited to, well defined interception points, laws, or combinations of IP 
interception and more conventional intelligence.
 [E.1.2] The HI2 interface has to support the ability to deliver
 IRI record(s), without delivering the contents of the 
message, when a target has downloaded E-mail. 
NOTE 2: How an E-mail receive is determined and intercep
ted is outside of the scope of the present document, 
however, that an E-mail was received and from whom it was sent is interesting to law enforcement. 
Likewise the information needed to
 intercept that an E-mail was received and from whom it was sent 
can be determined in many ways including, but limited to, well defined interception points, laws, or 
combinations of IP interception and more conventional intelligence. 
[E.1.3] The HI2 interface has to support the ability to deliv
er both the sender E-mail address and recipient E-mail 
addresses of E-mail as part of the "send" and "receive" events. 
NOTE 3: Neither sender nor recipient E-mail addresses are 
required because of differences in national laws or 
points of interception may not allow this informatio
n to be extracted. That being said, because of 
differences in national laws or points of inter
ception, both of these pieces of information may be 
available; therefore the ability to transfer both addresses is supported. 
[E.1.4] When HI2 is able to deliver an 
E-mail address, either sender or receive
r, the MF has not to be required to 
modify the address presentation. For example, if no domain name was present at intercept time, for example, 

the MF is not required to determine the domain name and append it. 
NOTE 4: Many reasons for this, including data integrity and cost, can be used. 
[E.1.5] The HI2 interface has to support a means of indicating how many recipient addresses could not be sent with 
the "send" or "receive" events due to limitations. 
NOTE 5: The pathological example is an SMTP intercept with a trillion RCPT TOs. Since there is no expectation 
that the intercept device or the MF have unlimited resources it is recognized that there is the possibility 
that some resource on some device in the chain may not be able to handle the number of RCPT TOs, 
and provide for a means to notify the LEA that this condition was hit. 
[E.1.6] The IETF RFC 5322 [7] E-mail message envelope fields of dates, source, and destination may be considered 
IRI. These fields are defined in IETF RFC 5322 [7]. 
NOTE 6: These fields clearly mark data that is traditional
ly passed via a control channel, and therefore should be 
treated as IRI. 
[E.1.7] The E-mail HI2 end record has to
 contain the following information, when present and available from the 
layer 3 and layer 4 protocols:  
- participating server and client addresses; 
- participating server and client ports (i.e. TCP port); 

- bytes sent by the server and client. 
NOTE 7: This information should be the control information that provides the LEA with an indication of the 
quantity of communication occurring. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)48 [E.1.8] E-mail HI2 has to be encoded using ASN.1 and BER. 
NOTE 8: This makes the data collectors' job easier as there is not separate encoding and does not impose any 
additional burden on the MF as it will have to extract the requisite information anyway and will have to 
support BER anyway. 
[E.1.9] The HI2 interface has to support the ability to deliver
 IRI record(s), without delivering the contents of any 
messages or passwords, when an attempt has been made 
to log into the target E-ma
il account. This record has 
to also contain the results of the logon attempt. 
NOTE 9: This has been required by LEAs. 
[E.1.10] The HI2 interface has to support a means of indicat
ing what E-mail applicatio
n service was intercepted. 
NOTE 10: This information can be helpful to the LEA for investigative purposes. 
[E.1.11] The HI2 interface has to support a means of indicatin
g the success or failure of an E-mail interaction to the 
degree that such information is available. 
[E.1.12] The HI2 interface has to support 
the ability to deliver the Message-ID. 
NOTE 11: The Message-ID supports the identification in E-mail log-files. 
[E.1.13] The authentication data resulting from either sending or downloading E-mail, has to be part of IRI in the case 
of application layer intercept. In the case of IP-packet interception, requirement [E.2.3] applies. 
NOTE 12: The choice between options is depending on implementation and subject to agreement between LEA 
and CSP. 
E.2 HI3 requirements 
[E.2.1] HI3 delivery of E-mail content has to include the entire E-mail message body. See IETF RFC 5322 [7] for a 
definition of the body. 
NOTE 1: Anything less would be incomplete data. 
[E.2.2] HI3 delivery of E-mail content has to include th
e entire E-mail envelope, when applicable. See IETF 
RFC 5322 [7] for a definition of the envelope. 
NOTE 2: The IETF RFC 5322 [7] envelope can be used by collectors to display the E-mail in a meaningful format. 
Likewise this is the only place that the envelope can be seen in its entirety. The value of the above two is 

considered worth the cost of po
tentially duplicating HI2 data. 
[E.2.3] In the case of IP packet interception, the authen
tication data resulting from either sending or downloading 
E-mail, has to be sent as part of HI3, in the form of the IP packets exchanged in the authentication. In the 

case of application layer interception, requirement [E.1.13] applies. 
NOTE 3: The choice between options is depending on implementation and subject to agreement between LEA and 
provider. 
[E.2.4] The IETF RFC 5322 [7] E-mail message body has to be considered content. 
NOTE 4: This is a positive way to express "E-mail message bodies will not go over HI2". 
[E.2.5] All IETF RFC 5322 [7] E-mail message envelope fields that are declared optional in IETF RFC 5322 [7] 
have to be considered content. 
NOTE 5: This is a positive way to express that optional fields do not go over HI2. The reason optional fields do not 
go over HI2 is that some clearly contain content, like the Subject and Comment fields, and the 

non-optional ones contain sufficient control information to make meaningful IRI. This distinction is easy 

to specify and does not appear to suffer any loss of functionality. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)49 [E.2.6] The E-mail HI3 has to contain a field that will in
dicate what application appendix has been used for the 
encoding of the CC. 
NOTE 6: Different levels of information and perhaps even slightly different formats can be expected based on the 
E-mail application intercepted. These differences are spelled out explicitly in the appendices to the 
present document. This requirement is to indicate which application appendix to use when interpreting the 

received CC. 
[E.2.7] E-mail HI3 has to support the abilit
y to send content in the same manner as an IP only content is sent, 
i.e. transfer the constituent IP level packets of 
the E-mail, including TCP acknowledgements. For the 
remainder of these requirements this has to be called "IP-packet" delivery.  
NOTE 7: For evidentiary reasons, some LEAs may require wire level communications as HI3. 
[E.2.8] E-mail HI3 has to support the abilit
y to send content in the format of the set of commands and data that 
constitute the E-mail; e.g. the payload of TCP packets in which the E-mail was transported. For the 

remainder of these requirements this has to be called "application" delivery. 
NOTE 8: As described in annex I, this type of HI3 can be derived from intercepting the TCP stream as well as from 
E-mail application level intercepts. In complex E-mail environments, the HI3 format allows for a hybrid 

interception approach to
 produce the same HI3 format throughout. 
NOTE 9: In the case of IP packet interception, the use of features such as STARTTLS, as defined in IETF 
RFC
 3207 [17] for SMTP and IETF RFC 2595 [18] and IETF RFC 4616 [19] for POP3 and IMAP, 
prohibit meeting the requirements defined in clauses E.1 and E.2 if the decryption key is not made 

available. 
E.3 General requirements 
[E.3.1] The target list (i.e. the list of people who are targets) is typically at least as sensitive as the results of 
interception and should be protected to appropriate national security standards.

SMTP characteristics 
F.1 SMTP service characteristics 
The fundamental service characteristic of an SMTP service is that it is a method of pushing E-mails from one host 
computer to another. The remaining text below is based on ideas expressed in IETF RFC 5321 [9]. 
The SMTP service can be divided by participants in two: the SMTP-client and the SMTP-server. Note that the 
SMTP-server need not be the ultimate destination of any of the E-mail, as is described for an SMTP relay function. 

Unfortunately IETF RFC 5321 [9] does not provide a concise description of these two participants so one will be 
provided here. 
The SMTP-client is the initiator of all actions while the SMTP-server has the final say as to the validity of these actions. 
The SMTP-client initiates an SMTP connection, logs onto the server (with no authentication), and proceeds to send as 

many E-mail messages as the SMTP-client currently has to send to the SMTP-server before quitting the session. The 

important concept to note is that a single SMTP session can transfer many E-mail messages in it, each message 

potentially from a different source E-mail address. 
The SMTP-server accepts connections and accepts or rejects each ac
tion a client attempts to initiate with the server. No 
SMTP action by the client can be 
considered valid or complete with
out the server accepting the action. 
The SMTP service can be divided by functionality into four: SMTP origination; SMTP delivery; SMTP relay; and 
SMTP gateway. For the purposes of the present document, however, the SMTP gateway service will be viewed as an 

SMTP delivery service because both services effectively remove the E-mail from SMTP and put it into another form. 

The enumeration of each of these functionalities can be found in IETF RFC 5321 [9], clause 2.3.8. 
Note that in none of the SMTP service functionalities does SMTP deal with the notion of a mailbox. SMTP deals 
exclusively with the notion of transferring E-mail messages where the domain portion of the SMTP mailbox name is 

used for routing of the E-mail. 
F.2 SMTP protocol characteristics 
The SMTP protocol characteristics are enumerated sufficiently in IETF RFC 5321 [9], clauses 3.1 to 3.3. The following 

characteristics are important to note. 
The SMTP login is un-authenticated and often unverified. There is no natural or guaranteed association between the 
login identity and any of the E-mails sent since multiple E-mails can be sent during a session and each E-mail sent 
individually specifies the sender with all recipients. 
The addresses that accompany the SMTP RCPT TO action are us
ed for routing the E-mail to
 the destination mailboxes. 
These addresses, therefore, can be reasonably relied on to 
be an accurate indicator of the intended recipients of the 
E-mail. 
There is no limit on the number of RCPT TO actions per E-mail message. 
The address that accompanies the SMTP MAIL FROM action is
 used to route replies to the E-mail. This address, 
therefore, may be spoofed with no loss of sending functionali
ty (i.e. the E-mail can still get to the intended recipient). 

There is only one MAIL FROM action per E-mail message. 

The addresses specified in the MAIL FROM action and the RCPT TO actions are fully qualified addresses (i.e. mailbox 
name and domain name). The fact that a SMTP address may be spoofed can be signalled using the ASN.1  
e-mail-Sender-Validity structure. In some cases the user has to authenticate before accessing the service. In this case the 
validity is available. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)51 Annex G (informative): 
POP3 characteristics G.1 POP3 service characteristics 
The fundamental service characteristic of a POP3 service is that it permits a workstation to dynamically access a 
mailbox on a server host in a useful fashion. Usually, this 
means that the POP3 protocol is used to allow a workstation 
to retrieve mail that the server is holding for it. POP3 is not intended to provide extensive manipulation operations of 

mail on the server (IETF RFC 1939 [8]). 
A normal POP3 service offers gross level queries on the status of the mailbox such as number of messages, size of 
messages, etc. The main functionality of the POP3 service, as it is used today, is the ability to download E-mail 
messages and delete E-mail messages from the mailbox. 
There is no POP3 service that offers the ability of injecting an E-mail into the Internet or uploading E-mail to the 
mailbox. In general SMTP or IMAP4 are used for these functionalities. 
G.2 POP3 protocol characteristics 
The POP3 protocol characteristics are enumerated sufficiently in IETF RFC 1939 [8], clause 3, and in detail in IETF 

RFC 1939 [8], clauses 4 to 6. The following characteristics are important to note. 
The POP3 login name has to identify the mailbox to be accessed however there is no standard as to how the mailbox 
identity is presented. Practically speaking most POP3 logins
 contain the mailbox name, sans domain name, or the fully 
qualified E-mail address, however, this is not guaranteed by the protocol. 
The senders E-mail address is not interpreted by the POP3 protocol. The senders address is, however, generally 
contained within the E-mail envelope of a properly formatted IETF RFC 5322 [7] message under the "From" field. 

Nominally the "From" address is filled in by the MAIL FROM address used in SMTP, however there is no guarantee of 
this. 
All POP3 operations on a mailbox specify messages via integer values, often indicative of the temporal ordering of 
messages within the mailbox. The only time useful intercept 
content is provided without a priori knowledge of the state 
of the mailbox is in response to retrieval commands RETR and TOP.

Discussion of webmail interception 
H.1 Webmail network topology 
A Webmail service is typically offered as part of an ISP se
rvice package. It allows for accessing an E-mail service from 
any Internet enabled computer via a web page, using a plain 
browser. The added value of a Webmail service is that it 
does not require specific configuration of an E-mail client and it allows for accessing E-mail from within a network that 
is connected to the Internet through a very restrictive firewall; most firewalls allow for HTTP traffic. 
Although not always appreciated by the original ISP/E-ma
il provider, a third party can also offer Webmail services 
based on the E-mail infrastructure of the ISP, by accessing the ISP's POP3 server via the Internet. Therefore, figure H.1 
depicts two types of Webmail servers; one within the own ISP's infrastructure and one inside a third party's 

infrastructure.

 The Webmail service can be used by customers logged-on via one of the ISP's access networks, but is more commonly 
used directly from the Internet. 
H.2 Webmail protocols 
As depicted in figure H.2, the Webmail server is positioned 
as an application server that abstracts the regular E-mail 
protocols for sending (SMTP) and r
eceiving (POP3) E-mail from the customer by means of a Web application. 
Typically, the Webmail server accesses the same SMTP and POP3 server(s) in the ISP infrastructure as customers with 

regular E-mail clients do.

  Figure H.2: Webmail protocols
 H.3 Webmail interception 
The HTTP messages that are exchanged between the Webm
ail application and the browser are not standardized, 
i.e. they are fully application dependant, and are theref
ore subject to potentially many and/or unannounced changes. 
Additionally, the customer may use a Webmail application from another provider, with obviously yet another 
implementation and therefore other HTTP messages being exchanged. Therefore, an approach that captures and 

interprets a HTTP based Webmail protocol will imply implementation and maintainability issues. 
Alternative to implementing Webmail protocol interpretation, the SMTP and POP3 interception devices designed 
regular E-mail interception at the SMTP and POP3 level can 
be used for intercepting Webmail activity. One issue with 
this approach is that the IP address from which the customer accesses the Webmail application cannot be easily derived 

from the captured SMTP/POP3 traffic because this will typical
ly contain the IP address of the Webmail server. Thus, in 
order to capture the customer's IP address, additional correlation between captured SMTP/POP3 traffic and the HTTP 

traffic or the web server log files will be required. 
In any case, due to the volatility and uncontrolled nature of the Webmail protocols, whatever interception may be 
possible specifically for Webmail, the expectation should be 
that E-mail IRI will not be extracted. The advice is to not 
attempt to define E-mail IRI (or E-mail content) explicitly to accommodate Webmail.

Discussion for Driving HI2 of HI3 
I.1 Introduction 
This clause presents a number of possibilities for intercepting E-mail and shows possible consequences for the HI3 
format of the intercepted E-mail message. It is included as 
in informative annex at this point in time to help generate 
requirements and focus discussion. 
Starting point: 
• E-mail messages will be send/received by mail-servers using SMTP over TCP/IP. 
• E-mail traffic can be intercepted on various layers in the E-mail transmission protocol. 
• In order to intercept an E-mail, the Mail address(es) in the E-mail require inspection. 
• In order to check the Mail address(es), processing of the intercepted data may be required.

-08)55 I.2.2 IP packets 
Data source: Layer 3 network filter. 
HI3 Output: N/A. 
An E-mail message cannot be intercepted by just copying the stream of IP datagrams that may contain E-mail. The 
problem here is the identification of the right E-mail messag
e, that is, to inspect the message for the target's E-mail 

address (or even detecting the presence of SMTP traffic in the 
IP datagrams). Therefore, IP datagrams are only useful as 

input to further processing, i.e. TCP Sequencing and Reassembly. 
I.2.3 TCP packets 
Data source: Layer 3/4 network filter. 
HI3 Output: TCP packets. 

E-mail messages can be intercepted by inspecting the TCP stream from or to the E-mail server (inspect all 
port 25 traffic for a given IP address). However, in order to
 reliably inspect the TCP payload for the occurrence of the 
target's E-mail address and in order to allow for reconstruction of the E-mail payload in case of a hit, the TCP packets 
have to be re-sequenced and possible defragmented. If the ra
w TCP packets were to be inspected as they came in, the 
occurrence of "out-of-sequence" packets or fragmented TC
P packets could prohibit succe
ssful identification of the 
targets E-mail address. Additionally, some interpretation of the SMTP encoding has to be performed, in order to not 

accidentally intercept an E-mail that contains, for example, 
the target's E-mail address as part of the content. This 
approach allows delivery of all TCP frames the make up the SMTP session that transmitted the E-mail message. A 

downside of this approach is that the extraction of HI2 information in relation to the intercepted E-mail is not 

straightforward. 
I.2.4 SMTP packets 
Data source: TCP sequencing and defragmentation process; or 
 Copy forward from E-mail server (SMTP). 

HI3 Output: ASCII or raw TCP representation of the SMTP session. 

More reliable detection of the target's E-mail address and more straightforward extraction of HI2 information can be 
achieved by processing the SMTP session itself. This requires implementation of an SMTP state machine, similar to 
that of the receiving end of an E-mail server, but less sophi
sticated. Data is either received from a TCP sequencing and 
reassembly process or by means of a CopyForward from an E-
mail server (see note). In this approach, all attributes of 
the E-mail message are available and the HI3 can consist of either an ASCII representation of the SMTP session or of 
the TCP packets that contain the SMTP session. 
NOTE: In latter case, it is also possible to implement interception functionality in the E-mail server itself, so that 
it can identify a target's E-mail messages and only forward those messages that require interception to the 

interception platform. The downside of the approach is
 the need for target information in an operational 
platform and the possibility of accidental disclosure of the interception (for example due to delivery 

failure notification in case the interception platform is down). 
I.2.5 E-mail messages 
Data source: SMTP reassembly process; or 
 Proprietary interface on the E-mail server. 

Output: Specific representation of the E-mail message. 

If the LEA does not allow for sending the data of the SMTP session as HI3 for an intercepted E-mail, further processing 
of the SMTP data into some specific representation of the E-mail message is required. This format can be LI specific or 
standardized, e.g. the Berkely format. The latter format could also be copied directly from the E-mail server.

-2 V3.10.1 (2016
-08)56 I.3 Conclusion 
The approach used for intercepting E-mail has a lot of impact
 on the HI3 format. Therefore, the various approaches to 
intercepting E-mail have to be discussed, before one or more HI3 formats can be selected.
