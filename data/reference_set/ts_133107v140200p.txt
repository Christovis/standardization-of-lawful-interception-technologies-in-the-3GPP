Foreword 
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3
rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). 
The contents of the present document are subject to conti
nuing work within the TSG and may change following formal 
TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an 
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows: 
Version x.y.z 
where: 
x the first digit: 
1 presented to TSG for information; 

2 presented to TSG for approval; 

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control. 
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of 
substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, 
updates, etc. 
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only
 changes have been incor
porated in the document. 
Introduction 
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3GPP 
TSG SA to allow for the standardisation in the area of 
lawful interception of telecommunications. This document describes in general the architecture and functions for lawful 
interception. Laws of individual nations and regional institutions (e.g. European Union), and sometimes licensing and 

operating conditions define a need to intercept telecommunications traffic and related information in modern 
telecommunications systems. It has to be noted that lawf
ul interception shall always be done in accordance with the 
applicable national or regional laws and technical regulations. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)153GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
1 Scope 
The present document describes the architecture and functional requirements within a Third Generation Mobile 
Communication System (3GMS) and the Evolved Packet System (EPS). 
The specification shows the service requirements from a Law Enforcement point of view only. The aim of this 
document is to define a 3GMS and EPS interception system that supports a number of regional interception regulations, 

but these regulations are not repeated here as they vary. Regional interception requirements shall be met in using 

specific (regional) mediation functions allowing only required information to be transported. 
The handover interfaces for Lawful Interception (LI) of Packet-Data Services, Circuit Switched Services, and 
Multimedia Services within the UMTS network and Ev
olved Packet System for Stage 3 are described in 
TS 33.108 [11].

3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations 
3.1 Definitions For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [13] and the following apply. 
Application layer:
 As defined by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 1123 [19].  
Closed access mode:
 H(e)NB provides services only to its associat
ed CSG members. A H(e)NB configured for closed 
access broadcasts a CSG Indicator and a specific CSG Identity.  

CUPS: As defined in 3GPP TS 23.214 [75], represents PLMN with architecture enhancements for control and user 
plane separation of EPC nodes.   

Hybrid access mode:
 H(e)NB provides services to its associated 
CSG members and to non-CSG members. A H(e)NB 
configured for hybrid access does not broadcast a 
CSG Indicator but does broadcast a CSG Identity. 
IP layer:
 As defined by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 1122 [18]. 
Interception Area: 
is a subset of the network service area comprised of a set of cells which defines a geographical 
zone. 

Location Dependent Interception:
 is interception of a target mobile within 
a network service area that is restricted to 
one or several Interception Areas (IA). 

Non-Local Identity: 
As defined by clause 5.1.2 General principles in TS 33.106 [7]. 
Open access mode:
 H(e)NB operates as a normal NodeB or eNodeB. A H(e)NB configured for open access does not 
broadcast either a CSG Indicator or CSG Identity. 

S8 Home Routed (S8HR): 
The term as used in this standard represen
ts a roaming architecture where PDN-GW and P-
CSCF are located in the HPLMN and therefore, UE IMS 
signalling and media are routed directly to the HPLMN 
through S8 reference point. Roaming architecture with S8HR for VoLTE is described in GSMA IR.65 [71] clause 2.4.3. 

Other LI specific definitions are given in TS 33.108 [11].

additional intercept configurations for Evolved 3GPP Packet Switching Domain are described in clause 12. 
NOTE 0: WLAN Interworking specifications (TS 23.234 [14], TS 24.234 [17] and TS 29.234 [16]) are no longer 
maintained for Release 12 onwards. This clause is therefore no longer maintained for WLAN 

Interworking. 
PS domain of the UMTS system (GSN and Multimedia Packet Data services), 3GPP-WLAN interworking network and 

Evolved Packet Switching Domain provide UMTS/GSM/EPS customer's mobile equipment (UE) with connectivity 

service to another end of the communication. Another end of
 the communication may be a network element (server) or 
another UE. Therefore, UMTS/EPS system provides IP layer TS 23.008 [15] services. Hence, UMTS/EPS NO/AP is 

responsible only for IP layer interception of CC data. In addition to CC data, the LI solution for UMTS/EPS offers 

generation of IRI records from respective control plane (s
ignalling) messages. The IP layer connectivity service is 
needed to support application layer TS 29.234 [16] service provision to UMTS/GSM/EPS customers. For instance, the 

following are examples of application layer services: email 
service; web browsing service; 
FTP service; audio services 
(e.g. VoIP, PoC); other multimedia services (MBMS, video telephony); The majority of the application layer services 

require addition of respective server functionality to the network. Note that it is not necessary that such application layer 

SP should be the same commercial entity as the UMTS/EPS AP/NO in question. 
When location information of the target is delivered by an 
ICE, the MF may need to add the civic address associated 
with the access network point as known by the CSP. The method used to obtain the civic address will depend on the 
CSP implementation. (e.g. by accessing a remote database). National regulations define whether the civic address needs 

to be provided. 
NOTE 1: For instance in MBMS a BM-SC and especially content providing server might be operated by different 
commercial entity than UMTS network. 
The LALS provides LCS information of the target on-demand, independently of the target's activity/events. 
Additionally, LALS may be triggered by any IRI event detected by an ICE to provide LCS location information of the 
target correlated to the triggering event. 
When IA is provisioned LCS may provide enhanced geographic capabilities

Regional Mediation Functions, which may be transparent or pa
rt of the administration and delivery functions, are used 
to convert information on the HI1, HI2 and HI3 interfaces in
 the format described in various national or regional 
specifications. For example, if ETSI ES 201 671 [3] or ANSI J-STD-025 [8] is used, then the adaptation to HI1, HI2 
and HI3 will be as defined in those specifications. 
There is one Administration Function (ADMF) in the network. Together with the delivery functions it is used to hide 
from the 3G ICEs that there might be multiple activations by different Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) on the same 
target. The administration function may be partitioned to ensure separation of the provisioning data from different 
agencies. 
See the remaining clauses of this document for definitions of the X1_1, X1_2, X1_3, X2, X3, LALS_T, Xia and Xib 
interfaces. These interfaces are specifically defined for LI and are not related to other interfaces/reference points having 

the same name specified in other 3GPP specifications (such as e.g. X2 interface specified in the e-UTRAN 
architecture). 
Interception at the Gateways is a national option. However, if 3G direct tunnel functionality with the GGSN, as defined 
in TS 23.060 [10], is used in the network, then the GGSN shall perform the interception of IRI and the content of 

communications. 
In figure 1a DF3 is responsible for two primary functions: 
- Call Control (Signalling) for the Content of Communication (CC); and 
- Bearer Transport for the CC. 
HI3 is the interface towards the LEMF. It must be able to
 handle the signalling and the bearer transport for CC. 
In figures 1a, 1b, 1e, 1f, 1g, 1h, 1i and 1j, the HI2 and HI3-interfaces represent the interfaces between the LEA and two 
delivery functions. The delivery functions are used: 
- to distribute the Intercept Related Information (IRI) to the relevant LEA(s) via HI2 (based on IAs, if defined); 
- to distribute the Content of Communication (CC) to the relevant LEA(s) via HI3 (based on IAs, if defined). 
In figures 1c, 1d and 1h the HI2 interface represents the interface between the LEA and the delivery function. The 
delivery function is used to distribute the Intercept Related Information (IRI) to the relevant LEA(s) via HI2. 
Figure 1g shows the CC interception configuration for VoIP. The trigger for the CC interception is provided by a SIP 
signalling node and identified within the figures as CC Interception Triggering Function. 
NOTE 2: With reference to figure 1c, CC interception does not apply to HLR. 
NOTE 3: For IMS, figure 1d relates to the provision of IRI for SIP messages handled by the CSCF. Interception of 
CC for this case can be done at the GSN under a se
parate activation and invo
cation, according to the 
architecture in Figure 1b (see also clause 7.A.1). For CC interception of VoIP, see figure 1g. 
NOTE 4: If an operator is required to support "HI1 notification over HI2" TS 33.108 [11], the X1_2 interface 
carries the information coming from the ADMF to the DF2/MF that will be conveyed to the LEMF.

 Figure 2: Functional model for La
wful Interception activation, 
deactivation and interrogation 
In addition to the typical 3G ICEs functional entities, a new functional entity is introduced - the ADMF - the Lawful 
Interception administration function. The ADMF: 
- interfaces with all the LEAs that may require
 interception in the intercepting network; 
- keeps the intercept activities of individual LEAs separate; 
- interfaces to the intercepting network. 
Every physical 3G ICE is linked by its own X1_1-interface to the ADMF. Consequently, every single 3G ICE performs 
interception (activation,
 deactivation, interrogation as 
well as invocation) independently from other 3G ICEs. The HI1-
interface represents the interface between the requester of
 the lawful interception an
d the Lawful administration 
function; it is included for completeness, but is beyond the scope of standardisation in this document. 
For VoIP CC Interception, the CC Interception Triggering Func
tion and the CC Intercept Function are treated as one 3G 
ICE from a Lawful Interception administration perspective. 
The target identities for 3GMS CS and PS interception at the SGSN, GGSN, 3G MSC Server and 3G GMSC Server can 
be at least one of the following: IMSI, MSISDN (or E.164 number for optional Non-Local ID) or IMEI. 
NOTE 1: Some communication content during a mobility procedure might not be intercepted when interception is 
based on MSISDN (only PS interception) or IMEI. The use of the IMSI does not have this limitation. For 

the availability of the target identities IMSI, MSISDN and IMEI (PS interception), refer to 
TS 23.060 [10]. 
The target identities for multi-media at the CSCF can be one or more of the following: SIP URI, TEL URI, or IMEI. 
Other identities are not defined in this release. The same identities (where available) are used as target identities for 

VoLTE interception in the VPLMN with S8HR. For VoLTE interception in the VPLMN with S8HR, the ADMF shall 

provision LMISF with the target identities. 
The target identities for 3GPP WLAN Interworking interception can be MSISDN, IMSI or NAI. For the availability of 
the target identities in the I-WLAN nodes (AAA server, PDG, WAG), refer to TS 23.234 [14], TS 23.008 [15], 
TS 29.234 [16] and TS 24.234 [17]. 
NOTE 2: The NAI might be a temporary ID, therefore the use of MSISDN or IMSI is recommended. 
NOTE 3: Void 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017

NOTE 3A: WLAN Interworking specifications (TS 23.234 [14], TS 24.234 [17] and TS 29.234 [16]) are no 
longer maintained for Release 12 onwards. This clause is therefore no longer maintained for WLAN 
Interworking. 
The target identities for 3GPP HNB interception can be IMSI, MSISDN (or E.164 number for optional Non-Local ID), 

IMEI, or ME Id. 
Use of the HNB ID or the CSG Iden
tity as a target identity is FFS. 
In the case of location dependent interception the following network/national options exist: 
- target location versus Interception Areas (IAs) check in the 3G ICEs and Delivery Functions (DFs); 

- target location versus IAs check in the DFs (physical co
llocation of the DFs to the 3G ICEs may be required by 
national law); 
- location dependent interception is not applicable to CSCF. 
NOTE 4: Void 
The IA is previously defined by a set of cells. From the location of the target this set of cells permits to find the relevant 
IA. 
NOTE 5: Void 
It is not required that the 3G GMSC or the 3G GGSN are 
used for interception when Location Dependent Interception 
is invoked and the location of the target is not available. 
NOTE 6: Location dependent intercept for the 3G MSC Server is not defined for this release. 
The ADMF shall be able to provision P-CSCFs independently from S-CSCFs. If both P-CSCFs and S-CSCFs are 

administered within the network for intercept, redundant mu
lti-media IRI may be presented to the agency as a result. 
When Non-Local ID interception is required by national regulation, the ADMF shall be able to provision S-CSCF, P-
CSCF, IBCF and MGCF independently of each other with the Non-Local ID as the target ID along with an indication 

that it is for a Non-Local ID interception, and nature of 
the interception (i.e. incoming calls and/or outgoing calls). 
5.1 Activation 
5.1.0 General 
Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the information flow for the activation of Lawful Interception. 
5.1.1 X1_1-interface 
The messages sent from the ADMF to the 3G ICEs (X1_1-interface) contain the: 
- target identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI, SIP URI or TEL URI, NAI) (see notes 4, 5, 6); 
- information whether the Content of Communication (CC) shall be provided (see note 1); 
- address of Delivery Function 2 (DF2) for the intercept related information (see note 2); 
- address of Delivery Function 3 (DF3) for the intercepted content of communications (see note 3); 

- IA in the case of location dependent interception: 

- indication whether the LALS Enhanced Location for IRI shall be provided. This indication is used to arm the 
LALS Triggering Function in the case when the LALS Triggering Function is associated with the ICE; 
- type of location report required (immediate or periodic) in the case of Target Positioning provision. 

NOTE 1: Void 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2

-07)303GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
As an option, the filtering whether intercept content of communications and/or intercept related information has to be 
provided can be part of the delivery functions. (Note that 
intercept content of communications options do not apply at 
the CSCF, HLR, LI LCS Client and AAA server). If the option is used, the corresponding information can be omitted 

on the X1_1-interface, while "information not present" means "intercept content of communications and related 

information has to be provided" for the ICE. Furthermore the delivery function which is not requested has to be 

"pseudo-activated", in order to prevent error cases at invocation. 
NOTE 2: Void 
As an option, only a single DF2 is used by and known to every 3G ICE. In this case the address of DF2 can be omitted. 
NOTE 3: Void 
As an option, only a single DF3 is used by and known to every 3G ICE (except at the CSCFs, HLR, LI LCS Client and 

AAA server). In this case the address of DF3 can be omitted. 
NOTE 4: Since the IMEI is not available, interception based on IMEI is not applicable at the 3G Gateway. 
Moreover, in case the IMEI is not available, intercep
tion based on IMEI is not applicable at 3G ICEs. 
NOTE 5: Void 
Interception at the CSCFs is based upon either SIP URI, T
EL URI or IMEI. The interception at the LMISF is also based 
on SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI. SIP URI and TEL URI as target identities are not supported by the other ICEs. The 

related CC interception also uses the SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI. 
NOTE 6: Interception based on NAI is only applicable at AAA server, PDG, and WAG. As the NAI could be 
encrypted or based on temporary identity at the PDG and WAG, interception based on the NAI is not 

applicable in those cases in these nodes. 
NOTE 7: Void 
If after activation subsequent Content of Communications (CC) or Intercept Related Information (IRI) has to be 

activated (or deactivated) an "activation change request" 
with the same identity of the target is to be sent.

Interception of a target can be activated on request from
 different LEAs and each LEA may request interception via a 
different identity. In this case, each target identity on which 
to intercept will need to be sent via separate activation 
messages from ADMF to the 3G ICEs on the X1_1-interface. Each activation can be for IRI only, or both CC and IRI. 
When several LEAs request activation on the same identity and the ADMF determines that there is an existing 
activation on the identity, the ADMF may (as an implementation option) send additional activation message(s) to the 

3G ICEs. When the activation needs to change from IRI only to CC and IRI an activation change message will be sent 
to the 3G ICEs.

In the case of a secondary interception activation only the relevant LEAs will get the relevant IRIs. 
5.1.2 X1_2-interface (IRI) 
For the activation of IRI the message sent from the ADMF to the DF contains: 
- the target identity; 
- the address(es) for delivery of IRI (= LEMF address); 
- optionally multiple addresses for distributed delivery of IRI to a single LEMF; 

- optionally a primary and failover address(es) for delivery of IRI to either a single LEMF or two different 
LEMFs for the same LIID. 
- Which subset of information shall be delivered; 

- an indication whether the LALS Enhanced Location for IRI 
shall be delivered. This indication is used to arm the 
LALS Triggering Function in the case when the LALS Triggering Function is associated with the DF; 
- a DF2 activation identity, which uniquely identifies the activation for DF2 and is used for further interrogation or 
deactivation, respectively; 
- the IA in case of location dependent interception; 

- interception of international outbound roaming IMS VoIP interception (allowed/not allowed); 

- the warrant reference number if required by national option. 
If a target is intercepted for several LEAs and/or several identities simultaneously, a single activation of delivery is 
necessary for each combination of LEA and identity.

When several LEAs requested activation on the same identity and subsequently request deactivation then the ADMF 
determines that there are remaining activations on the identity. In this case, the ADMF will not send a deactivation 

message to the 3G ICEs except when the activation needs to change from CC and IRI to IRI only. In that case an 

activation change message will be sent to the 3G ICEs.

The HI2 and HI3 interfaces represent the interfaces between the LEMF and two delivery functions. Both interfaces are 

subject to national requirements. They are 
included for completeness, but are beyond the scope of standardization in this 
document. The delivery functions are used: 
- to convert the information on the X2-interface to 
the corresponding information on the HI2-interface; 
- to convert the information on the X3-interface to 
the corresponding information on the HI3-interface; 
- to distribute the intercept related information to the relevant LEA(s) (based on IAs, if defined); 
- to distribute the intercept content of communications 
to the relevant LEA(s) (based on IAs, if defined). 
For the delivery of the CC and IRI, the 3G MSC Server prov
ides a correlation number and 
target identity to the DF2 
and DF3 which is used to select the different LEAs to which the product shall be delivered. 
NOTE: Void 
If interception has been activated for both parties of the ca
ll both CC and IRI will be delivered for each party as separate 
intercept activity. 

The Mc interface between the 3G MSC Server and MGW is used
 to establish intercept and 
deliver the bearer to DF3. 
For Location Dependent Interception, the location dependency check occurs at the establishment of each call. 
Subsequent dependency checks for simultaneous calls are not required, but can be a national option. 
If a target is marked using an IA in the 3G MSC Server, the 3G MSC Server shall perform a location dependency check 
at call set-up. Only if the target's location matches the IA then the call is intercepted. 
If a target is marked using an IA in the DF2, the DF2 sha
ll perform a location dependency check at reception of the first 
IRI for the call. Only if the target's location matches the IA for certain LEAs is IRI the relayed to these LEAs. All 
subsequent IRIs for the call are sent to the same LEAs.

6.3.0 General 
Intercept Related Information (Events) are necessary at the Begin and End of the call, for all supplementary services 
during a call and for information which is not call associated. There are call related events and non-call related events. 
On top of IRI generated by events from the 3G MSC Server, national regulations may require to complement them by 
IRI produced by a Delivery Function 2 associated to the HLR and/ or LI LCS Client. 
Figure 15 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If an event for / from a mobile subscriber 
occurs, the 3G MSC Server sends the relevant data to the DF2.

switched supplementary services 
6.4.1 Interception of Multiparty call 
 Figure 16: Interception of Multiparty for CC 
Figure 16 shows the delivery of CC from intercepted multiparty call where party A is the target of interception. 
One pair of call content channels are delivered to the delivery function. Party A is delivered to the DF3 on one channel 
and the sum of the balance of the parties, B,C and D is delivered on the second channel. 
It should be noted that if parties B,C or D is a target of interception, that intercept is treated as a simple call intercept. 
The events contain information about B, C and D if subscriber A is monitored. If one of B, C or D is monitored, events 
contain the information about A but not the other parties of the conference.

The HI2 and HI3 interfaces represent the interfaces between the LEA and two delivery functions. Both interfaces are 
subject to national requirements. They are included for comple
teness, but are beyond the scope of this specification. The 
delivery functions are used: 
- to convert the information on the X2-interface to 
the corresponding information on the HI2 interface; 
- to distribute the intercept related information to the relevant LEA(s); 
- to distribute the intercept product to the relevant LEA(s). 

For the delivery of the CC and IRI the 3G SGSN and/or, per national option 3G GGSN provides correlation number and 
target identity to the DF2 and DF3 which is used there in or
der to select the different LEAs where the product shall be 
delivered. When the SGSN connects an UE to a S-GW throu
gh the S4 interface (TS 23.060 [10], see also note 3), the 
SGSN is not required to provide CC for that communication (see note 4). 
The correlation number is unique in the whole PLMN and is us
ed to correlate CC with IRI and the different IRI's of one 
PDP context. 
The correlation number shall be generated by using existing parameters related to the PDP context. 

When the SGSN connects an UE to a S-GW
 through the S4 interface (TS 23.060 [10], see also note 3), the SGSN is not 
required to provide IRIs for PDP contexts associated w
ith CC and correlation for that communication (see note 4). 
NOTE 1: Void 
If interception has been activated for both parties of the Packet Data communication both CC and IRI shall be delivered 
for each party as separate intercept activity. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)493GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
In case of location dependent interception: 
- for each target, the location dependency check occurs at each Packet Data session establishment or release and at 
each Routing Area (RA) update to determine permanently the relevant IAs (and deduce, the possible LEAs 
within these IAs); 
- concerning the IRI: 
- when an IA is left, either a Mobile Station Detach event is sent when changing servicing 3G GSNs, or an RA 
update event is sent; 
- RA update event is sent to DF2 when changing IAs inside the same servicing 3G SGSN; 
- when a new IA is entered a RA update event is sent to DF2 and, optionally, a "Start of interception with PDP 
context active" event for each PDP context; 
- concerning the CC, when crossing IAs, the CC is not sent anymore to the DF3 of the old IA but sent to the DF3 
of the new IA. 
Both in case of location dependent and location independent interception: 

"Start of interception with PDP context active" event is sent by the new SGSN if an Inter-SGSN RA update procedure, 
which involves different PLMNs, takes place for a target, which has at least one active PDP context. 
NOTE 2: An SGSN can differentiate "Inter PLMN" type of Inter-SGSN RA update procedure from "Intra PLMN" 
type of Inter-SGSN RA update procedure by inspecting the old RAI parameter, which is being received 
by the SGSN as part of the procedure (see TS 23.060 [10], clause 6.9.1.2.2 and TS 23.003, clause 4.2). 
Optionally, it is possible to send "Start of interception with PDP context active" for all cases of inter- SGSN RA update 
when at least one PDP context is active. 
NOTE 3: S4 is an intra-PLMN reference point between the SGSN and the S-GW. 
NOTE 4: Void 
When the SGSN connects an UE to a S-GW through the S4
 interface, the S-GW provides IRI, CC and correlation for 
the EPS bearer associated to the PDP 
context, as specified in clause 12. 
7.1 Provision of Intercept 
Product - Short Message Service 
Figure 19 shows an SMS transfer from the 3G SGSN node to the LEA. Quasi-parallel to the delivery from / to the 
mobile subscriber a SMS event, which 
contains the content and header of the SMS, is generated and sent via the 
Delivery Function 2 to the LEA in the same way as the Intercept Related Information. National regulations and warrant 
type determine if a SMS event shall contain only SMS 
header, or SMS header and SMS content. Non-Local ID 
targeting is optional and may require traffic analysis. 
The IRI will be delivered to the LEA: 
- for a MO-SMS. Dependent on national requirements, delivery shall occur in the following cases: 
- when the 3G SGSN receives the SMS from the target MS, or when the 3G SGSN detects that an SMS is to 
the Non-Local ID target. 
- when the 3G SGSN receives notification that the SMS-Centre successfully received the SMS that was 
originated from the target MS, or sent to the Non-Local ID target; 
- for a MT-SMS. Dependent on national requirements, delivery shall occur in the following cases:

In addition to the intercepted content of communications, the following information needs to be transferred from the 3G 
GSN to the DF3 in order to allow the DF3 to perform its functionality: 
- target identity; 
- correlation number; 
- time stamp - optional; 
- direction (indicates whether T-PDU is MO or MT) - optional; 

- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent interception. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)513GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
As a national option, in the case where the 3G GGSN is pe
rforming interception of the content of communications, the 
target is handed off to another SGSN and the same 3G GGSN continues to handle the content of communications 

subject to roaming agreements, the 3G GGSN shall contin
ue to perform the interception of the content of 
communication. 
If 3G direct tunnel functionality with the GGSN, as defined in TS 23.060 [10], is used in the network, then the GGSN 
shall perform the interception of the content of communications. 
7.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information 
7.3.0 General 
Intercept Related Information (Events) are necessary at the 
Mobile Station Attach, Mobile Station Detach, PDP Context 
Activation, Start of intercept with PDP context active, PDP Context Deactivation, RA update, Serving System, Packet 
Data Header Information, and SMS events. 
Other HLR, Non-Local ID targeting for SMS (e.g. based on traffic analysis), LI LCS Client related and
 Serving System 
events reporting are national options. 

Packet Data Header Information 
reporting is a national option. 
Figure 21 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If an event for / from a mobile subscriber 
occurs, the 3G GSN, LI LCS Client or the Home Location 
Register (HLR) sends the relevant data to the DF2. For 
Packet Data Header Information reporting, a 3G GSN either is
olates the relevant data and sends it to the DF2 or sends 
the packet stream to another entity in the network (e.g., DF3) for isolation which then provides the relevant data to the 

DF2. 
See clause 7A for multi-media Intercept Related Information produced at the CSCF. 
 Figure 21: Provision of Intercept Related Information 
7.3.1 X2-interface 
The following information needs to be transferred from the 3G GSN, LI LCS Client or the HLR to the DF2 in order to 
allow a DF2 to perform its functionality: 
- target identity (MSISDN or E. 164 number for Non-Local ID, IMSI, IMEI); 
- events and associated parameters as defined in clauses 7.3.2 and 7.4 may be provided; 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)523GPP TS 33.107 vers
ion 14.2.0 Release 14
- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent interception; 
- Correlation number; 

- Quality of Service (QoS) identifier; 

- Encryption parameters (keys and associated paramete
rs for decrypting CC), if available and necessary. 
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism. 

The 3G GSN detects packets containing p
acket data header information in the communications path but the information 
needed for Packet Data Header Informatio
n reporting may need to be transferred fr
om the 3G GSN either directly to the 
DF2 or via another entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. 
7.3.2 Structure of the events 
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2 if this is required. Details are described in 
the following clause. The events for interception are configur
able (if they are sent to DF2) in the 3G GSN, LI LCS 
Client or the HLR and can be suppressed in the DF2. 
The following events are 
applicable to 3G SGSN: 
- Mobile Station Attach; 
- Mobile Station Detach; 

- PDP context activation; 

- Start of interception with mobile station attached (national option); 

- Start of intercept with PDP context active; 

- PDP context modification; 
- PDP context deactivation; 
- RA update; 

- SMS; 

- Packet Data Header Information. 

NOTE: Void 
3G GGSN interception is a national option. Location information may not be available in this case. If interception is 
performed at the 3G GGSN, then Packet Data Header Info
rmation reporting shall also be performed at the 3G GGSN 
and not at the 3G SGSN. 
If 3G direct tunnel functionality with the GGSN, as defined in TS 23.060 [10], is used in the network, then both the 
SGSN and the GGSN shall perform the interception of intercept related information. 
When the SGSN connects an UE to a S-GW through the S4 
interface (TS 23.060 [10]), the SGSN is not required to 
report events PDP context activation (successful), Start of in
tercept with PDP context activ
e, PDP context modification, 
PDP context deactivation; the SGSN shall report unsuccessful PDP context activation event. 
The following events are ap
plicable to the 3G GGSN: 
- PDP context activation; 
- PDP context modification; 

- PDP context deactivation; 
- Start of interception with PDP context active; 
- Packet Data Header Information. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)533GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
The following events are 
applicable to the HLR: 
- Serving System; 
- HLR subscriber record change; 

- Cancel location; 

- Register location; 

- Location information request. 
The following LALS Repo
rts are applicable to 
Packet Data services
 (see Clause 19): 
- Report for LALS Target Positioning; 

- Report for LALS Enhanced Location for IRI. 
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events trigger the transmission of the 
information from 3G GSN, LI LCS Client or HLR to DF2,
 perhaps via a MF in the case of Packet Data Header 
Information. Available IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the 3G GSN or HLR, if this is 

necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information if this is necessary as a national option e.g. a 

unique number for each surveillance warrant.

comprehensive since normally, the old SGSN does not receive the new SGSN's RAI, while the new 

SGSN does receive the old SGSN's RAI from UE with the RAU Request message. 
7.4.7 SMS 
For SMS-MO, the event is generated in the 3G SGSN. Dependent on national requirements, event generation shall 

occur in the following cases: 
- when the 3G SGSN receives the SMS from the target MS, or when the 3G SGSN detects that an SMS is to the 
Non-Local ID target. 
- when the 3G SGSN receives notification that the SMS-Centre successfully received the SMS that was originated 
from the target MS, or sent to the Non-Local ID target. 
For SMS-MT, the event is generated in the 3G SGSN. Dependent on national requirements, event generation shall 

occur in the following cases: 
- when the 3G SGSN receives the SMS from the SMS-Centre when the SMS was originated from a Non-Local ID 
target, or will have to be sent to a target MS. 
- when the 3G SGSN receives notification that recipien

 7.4.11.2 Packet Data Summary Report 
This event is used to report: 
1) the source and destination information derived from the packet headers, including: 
a) source and destination IP Addresses, 
b) IP next-layer protocol, 

c) Layer-4 ports, and 

d) Flow label, if the packet is IPv6 
2) summary information for the number of packets and bytes transmitted or received by the target for each unique 
packet flow within a PDP context, and 
3) the date and the time of the first and last packets associated with that packet flow. A packet flow is defined as the 
6-tuple of source/destination IP address/port number and the layer 4 protocol, and PDP Context. 

IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always re
ported, the flow label is reported if the packet is IPv6, 
and the layer-4 ports are reported. 
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique p
acket data session (PDP context) and packet flow, and is 
triggered by one of the following: 
- start of a packet flow associated with a PDP Context 

- an interim report for a packet flow associated with a PDP Context is to be reported 

- end of a packet flow associated with a PDP Context (including end of the PDP Context itself). 
An interim report can be triggered by 
- The expiration of a configurable timer per inter
cept (called a Summary Timer). The Summary Timer is 
configurable in units of seconds; 
- A per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached. 
These elements will be delivered either directly to 
DF2 or via an MF for each packet flow if available:

 7.5 Void  7.6 Interception of the Mult
imedia Messaging Service (MMS) The Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a service running over the 3GPP PS-domain. Both mobile originating and 
mobile terminating MMS messages must pass through PS domain GSN nodes en route to or from Multimedia Message 
Service Centres (MMSCs). Therefore, interception of MMS 
messages shall be performed at the GSN in exactly the 
same way as for other PS-domain bearer services. 
The GSN is not responsible for recovering individual MMS messages from the user PDP context IP stream. 

No MMS specific HI2 records are defined 
to be delivered to the LEMF over the DF2 other than those listed in 
clause 7.4 of this specification. CC records shall be sent 
to the LEMF over the DF3 as specified in clause 7.3. 
Interception of a user PDP context IP stream will occur as described in clause 7.2. Such a stream may or may not 
contain MMS messages.

7A Invocation of Lawful 
Interception for Packet Data 
Multi-media Service 
7A.1 Provision of content of communications 
Interception of the content of communications for GSN packet data services is explained in clause 7.2.. Activation and 
invocation of lawful interception for multi-media service only at the CSCF(s) does not produce interception of content 

of communications. Consequently, a separate activation and invocation of lawful interception must occur at a node that 

has access to the CC (e.g., in case of GPRS / UMTS 
(PS domain) interception of CC occurs at the GSN). 
Interception at the GSN is only possible for a basic call. 
For the interception of content of communications of IMS-
based voice services including CC for forwarde
d and transferred calls, refer to clause 15. 
7A.1.A Decryption for IMS Media Plane Security 
This clause describes how the TSP can meet the national requirements in Clause 5.1.2 of TS 33.106 [7] to deliver 

intercepted communications decrypted when the TSP uses TS
 33.328 [25] IMS Media Plane Security options. If an 
ICE, in TSP IMS network using Security options TS 33.328 [25], allows interception of Content of Communication in 

clear then this clause does not apply. 
If Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions for Media Streams (SDES) is used, the DF2 shall identify 
the SDES keys from the SDP offer and SDP answer message
s and provide the DF3 with the necessary SDES related 
parameters. In this case, the DF3 shall perform the decryption prior to delivery to the LEMF. For the CC delivered to 
the LEMF in a decrypted form, the DF2 shall remove the SDES keys when present from the SDP offer and SDP answer 

messages sent to the LEMF over HI2. The interface between 
the DF2 and DF3 to support the transfer of session keys is 
outside the scope of this specification. 
When SDES is used in end-to-access edge mode, the P-CSCF shall intercept SDES keys from SDP messages and shall 
deliver them to the DF2. 
If a Key Management Service (KMS) and Multimedia Internet KEYing ticket (MIKEY-TICKET) is used, the TSP may 
use the mechanism as defined in Clause 7A.7.1, which results 
in the DF2 receiving the sessio
ns keys needed to decrypt 
the intercepted communications. Clause 7A.7.1 defines that the DF2 delivers the keys to the LEMF as IRI in order for 

the LEMF to decrypt the intercepted traffic. 
If the network is to decrypt the content of communications prior to delivery to the LEMF via HI3, the DF2 shall provide 
the DF3 with the sessions keys as defined in Clause 7A.7.1 instead of to the LEMF. In this case, the DF3 shall perform 
the decryption prior to deliver
y to the LEMF. The interface between the DF2 and DF3 to support the transfer of session 
keys is outside the scope of this specification. 
7A.2 Provision of IRI 
7A.2.1 Provision of IRI with SIP messaging 
SIP messaging is reported as Intercept Related Information for the interception of multi-media service. As shown in 

figure 22 below, all SIP messages executed on behalf of a target are subject to intercept at the S-CSCF and Optionally 

P-CSCF. Based upon network configuration, the ADMF shall provision P-CSCFs, or S-CSCFs, or both P-CSCFs and S-

CSCFs with SIP URI, TEL URI, or IMEI target identifiers. 
For Non-Local ID interception, 
the target identifiers are SIP 
URI or TEL URI. These resulting intercepted SIP messages shall be sent to DF2 for mediation prior to transmittal 
across the HI2 interface. 
For roaming scenarios, interception at the P-CSCF shall be 
Mandatory, in order to provide IRI Interception in the 
visited network, where the P-CSCF is located in the Visi
ted Network. Where the P-CSCF is located in the Home 
Network, interception at the P-CSCF shall be Optional, subject to national regulation. When S8HR is the roaming 

architecture, the P-CSCF is located in the HPLMN. Refer to clause 20 for the description of related lawful interception 

capabilities.

  Figure 22: Provision of Intercept Related Information for multi-media 
When Non-Local ID interception is required for incoming calls, ICE shall trigger interception by target id in any of the 
SIP headers used to identify the calling party information and redirecting party information present in the incoming SIP 

message. The examples are: P-Asserted Id, From headers and History-Info, Diversion headers. 
When Non-Local ID interception is required for outgoing calls, ICE shall trigger interception by target id in any of the 
SIP headers used to identify 
the called party information present in the outgoing SIP message. The examples are: 
Request URI and To headers. 
7A.2.2 Provision of IRI with XCAP messages 
The AS that store the XCAP data of the target shall intercept and transmit to the DF2 any XCAP based messages related 

to actions by the target, related to the supplementary service and other target's service settings, defined in 

TS 24.623 [55]: 
- on the Ut interface, 
- on other interface to any AS with XCAP 
server capability that uses XCAP protocol
. The DF2 will encapsulate the information as an IRI to the LEMF. 
NOTE 1: The XCAP services separation through XCAP filtering or the application of Operator Policy function for 
national regulation is outside of the scope of this specification as an implementation issue. 
Every successful or unsuccessful IMS supplementary services setting modification management request and response 
between UEs and IMS service nodes, or from other access to the target's XCAP servers shall be reported. In case of IRI 
only, any filtering of XCAP messages based on operator policy or national regulation is for further studies. 
NOTE 2: Report of events related to target's XCAP data 
and resources access by non XCAP protocol are for further 
studies. 
7A.2.3 Provision of IRI with Di
ameter messages related to HSS

information request could be generated by an IP-SM-GW AS (as an SMS Centre) or GMSC or SGSN or MME from 

another Network through a diameter request transmitted by eith
er an AS or the I CSCF of the home network to the HSS 
of the target. The event will be triggered by the following Diameter messages: 
- Through Sh interface, User Da
ta Request with content related to update location from AS to HSS, see clause A.2 
of TS 29.328 [63] and TS 29.329 [66];

The enhanced P-CSCF (eP-CSCF) shall adhere to all LI re
quirements pertaining to the P-CSCF described in clause 
7A.2.1. Any additional LI requirements pertaining to 
the support of WebRTC Interworking, as specified in 
TS 23.228 [43], that only apply to the eP-CSCF are described distinctly. 
WebRTC Web Server Function (WWSF), if provided by the CSP, is an ICE that is used to copy and transmit via the DF 
to the LEMF the IP address and port used by the target as viewed by the WWSF. This IP address may be a public or 
private address depending on how the target accesses the WWSF. 
WebRTC Authorisation Function (WAF), if provided by the 
CSP, is an ICE that creates a time-stamped authentication 
event associated with the target including relevant inform
ation such as the user's identity provided to the WAF. 
Further details of the WWSF and WAF are FFS. 
7A.3 Multi-media events 
7A.3.0 General 
- All SIP messages to or from a target, and all SIP messages
 executed on behalf of a target for multi-media session 
control are intercepted by the S-CSCF and Optionally P-CSCF and sent to DF2. The target identifier used to 
trigger the intercept will also be sent with the SIP message. This standard does not require nor prohibit redundant 
information from being reported to DF2. 
- Where a CSCF which provides lawful interception ma
kes changes to a SIP message, sent to or from or 
executed on behalf of a target then the CSCF shall report both the original message and the modified message 
to the DF2. 
- Where a CSCF which provides lawful interception changes identities within a SIP message ( e.g. IMPI/IMPU 
changes or due to call forwarding etc.) and the new identit
y is the target, then both the original and modified 
SIP messages shall be reported to DF2. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.
2.0 (2017
-07)713GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
- Where a CSCF which provides lawful interception changes identities within a SIP message (e.g. IMPI/IMPU 
changes or due to call forwarding etc.) and the new id
entity is not the target, then both the original and 
modified SIP messages shall be reported to DF2. 
- P-CSCF event reports may be redundant with S-CSCF event reports when the P-CSCF and S-CSCF reside in the 
same network, however, this standard does not require nor prohibit redundant information from being reported to 
DF2. 
- Non-Local ID interception will be made by S-CSCF or
 P-CSCF (optional in a non-roaming case, and mandatory 
in the roaming case when LBO approach is used as
 the roaming architecture). As national option, the 
interception functions may also be provided by the IBCF or MGCF for a non-roaming case. Of the two 

approaches S-CSCF/P-CSCF Vs IBCF/MGCF used for non-ro
aming case, only one approach is required to be 
supported within a CSP's network. With S8HR as the roaming architecture, the Non-Local ID interception in the 
VPLMN will be made by the LMISF (see clause 20). 
- For interception of incoming calls of Non-Local ID, any 
of the SIP headers used to identify the calling party 
information and redirecting party information present 
in the incoming SIP message. The examples are: P-
Asserted Id, From headers and History-Info, Diversion headers. 
- For interception of outgoing calls of Non-Local ID, an
y of the SIP headers used to identify the called party 
information present in the outgoing SIP message. 
The examples are: Request URI and To headers. 
- The IRI should be sent to DF2 with a reliable transport mechanism. 
- Correlation for SIP to bearer shall be supported within the domain of one provider. 

- An intercepted SIP event sent to DF2 is shown below: 
- Observed SIP URI 

- Observed TEL URI 

- Observed IMEI (Not in the case of Non-Local ID interception) 
- Event Time and Date 
- Network element identifier 

- SIP Message Header 

- SIP Message Payload 

- VPLMN ID 
NOTE 1: The Observed IMEI is obtained from the +sip.ins
tance.id of the intercepted SIP message (as defined in 
TS 24.229 [49]). 
- All IMS XCAP messages to or from a target for multi-media or supplementary services are intercepted by the 
AS, or the group of AS in charge to transmit, manipulate and store any IMS XCAP of that target. The data have 
to be transmitted either "en clair" or encrypted with all elements to let the LEMF decrypt the data. The generated 

IRI should be sent in any case to DF2. 
 NOTE 2: The data related to XCAP management and the XCAP documents modification of the target, as 
supplementary services, or as the 3GPP or OMA presence services (TS 24.141 , OMA Presence SIMPLE 

specification and IETF RFC 4827), are reported through the DF2. However, these are points are currently 

not covered: 
1) other data (XCAP management and the XCAP documents modification by the target) to be 
transmitted but related to other multimedia services; 
2) the case of XCAP messages that are based on different interfaces than Ut interface; 
3) the specific architecture related to encrypted data; 

4) Detailed XCAP events, related to authentication. 
- An intercepted XCAP report sent to DF2 is shown below: 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)723GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
- Observed SIP URI or Tel URI, based on XUI (described in IETF RFC 4825 [56]) or information in the 
XCAP payload (if available). 
- Observed XUI or any other identities (if available). 
- Event Time and Date. 

- Network element identifier. 

- XCAP Message (the entire elements of the HTTP Header and the XCAP payload). 
NOTE 3: Void. 
The interpretation of XCAP messages, such as HTTP request through the Ut interface between the target's UE and 
related XCAP server may sometime be insufficient to let the LEA to understand what was modified as directed by the 

UE, therefore a later HTTP response is needed to understand the success or failure of the request. 
 Specific Diameter messages, to or from or related to a ta
rget, are intercepted by the HSS in charge of that target. 
The generated IRI should be sent in any case to DF2. Events and IRI are described below: 
 Such events are: 
- Serving System; 
- When IMPU or IMPI is changed in
 a HSS subscriber record change; 
- Registration termination 

- Location information request. 
 Contents of such IRI report related to HSS sent to DF2, is shown below: 
- Observed SIP URI or Tel URI or IMSI; 

- Observed any other identities (if available); 

- Event Time and Date; 

- Network element identifiers; 

- Network Identifier (if available and only in case of roaming) 
- Target profile or data elements (if available). 
7A.3.1 Mid IMS Session Interception 
7A.3.1.0 General 
Mid IMS Session interception functionality applies in addition to other IMS LI functional requirements as defined in 
section 7A. 
Where LI is activated on a target within a CSCF after an IMS session has already been established the CSCF shall do 
one of the following; 
- Where the CSCF has stored the media session information which occurred prior to the interception activiation, 
the CSCF shall provide a "start of interception with IMS session" event message, to the DF2/MF over the X2 

interface, including the parameter and information listed in table 7A.3.1, if available. 
- Where the CSCF has not stored media session information which occurred prior to the interception activation, 
the CSCF shall report all future SIP messages which the CS
CF is able to identify as associated with an ongoing 
target session. In this case, the event "start of interception with IMS session" is not applicable. 
It is a national option whether the CSCF shall be mandated to store the necessary information to support reporting of 
session establishment parameters, in order to support mid IMS session interception, or whether the CSCF shall only 
report SIP messages which occur after the interception is applied and the CSCF is able to identify as related to an 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)733GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
ongoing target session. If information 
is stored then it shall be possible to
 set a maximum storage time according to 
national and/or operator requirements.

The points above on requirements in this clause applicable to CSCF support of mid IMS Session interception, shall 
apply to IBCF which incorporate IC
E for Non-Local ID interception. 
7A.3.1.1 SDES Media Security 
If an SDES crypto attribute is included in the SDP, the DF2/MF forwards the "start of interception with IMS session" 

event message to the LEMF over HI2 without additional key processing. 
NOTE: The SDES Crypto attribute contains the crypto
graphic key required for decrypting the encrypted IMS 
media. 
If SDES mid session support is required then storing of media information as per 7A.3.1 is mandatory. 
7A.4 Multi-media Call State Control Service Scenarios 
Annex C shows examples of the delivery of intercepte
d events and product under various call scenarios. 
7A.5 Push to talk over Cellular (PoC) 
PoC is a service of the IMS Domain and interception is done 
according the definitions in clause 7A.3. Interception of 
CC is available with the current implementations in the GSNs. 
7A.6 SMS over IMS 
SMS over IMS shall be intercepted in accordance with norm
al IMS interception as described in 7A.3, also for Non-
Local ID interception. SMS IRI (including originating and destination addresses, SMS direction, and SMS Centre 

Address) are reported, if available, for IRI-only intercepts. 
7A.7 LI for KMS based IMS Media Security 
7A.7.1 LI Architecture and functions 
KMS based IMS media security is specified in TS 33.328 [25]. The present clause specifies LI architecture and 

functions needed to provide session encryption keys genera
ted by the KMS to protect IMS media for a subscriber who 
is a target for interception in the IMS nodes. This sectio
n is applicable to the cases in which the KMS is under 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)743GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
responsibility of the Operator providing the IMS network infrastructure. Other scenarios such as the one in which the 
KMS is run by an independent legal entity are outside the scope of this specification. 
NOTE 1: It is FFS whether the Xk interface defined in this section can be used also by the LEMF to directly query 
the KMS as an additional option. 
NOTE 2: This section covers the scenario in which encr
ypted content of communication is provided to the LEMF 
together with encryption keys, to allow decryption at LEMF. 
Figure 7A.7.1 shows the LI architecture for the case in which decryption is performed by the LEMF and a KMS is used 

to support IMS media security, with a Xk interface defined between the DF2/MF and the KMS, in addition to the 

interfaces and functional entities needed to support LI in the P-CSCF/S-CSCF.

 Figure 7A.7.1: KMS Intercept configuration 
When LI has been activated in the P/S-CSCF for a target, 
the node will report SIP messages events on the X2 interface, 
as specified in section 7.A and subsections. The DF2/MF
 shall extract from the intercepted SIP signalling the 
information related to the encryption and send a request over the Xk interface to the KMS to derive the encryption keys; 

the request will carry also the reference to the ticket transferred by the SIP signalling between the parties involved in the 
communication. The KMS shall then, based on the information received from the DF2, resolve the ticket and provide 
the session keys to the DF2/MF over the Xk interface. 
7A.7.2 Signalling over the Xk interfaces and LI events 
The following messages are defined over the Xk interface: 
- get_keys 
- get_keys_response 
The message get_keys shall be sent by the DF2/MF to the KMS in order to ask the KMS to provide session keys for an 
ongoing communication. 
The message get_keys_response shall be sent by the KMS to the DF2/MF in order to provide the session keys. 
The message get_key_response defines a LI event provided by the KMS to the DF2/MF which shall then be sent by the 
DF2/MF to the LEMF in a proper IRI record over the HI2 interface. 
Table 7A.7.2.1 provides the list of parameters, which shall be carried by the message get_keys, in order to transfer to 
the KMS the information, as specified in TS 33.328 
[25], needed to provide th
e session encryption keys:

Table 7A.7.2.1: Parameters and information in message get_keys 
Public KMS Identity of the target user 
TRANSFER_INIT 
TRANSFER_RESP 
 Upon reception of get_keys message, the KMS shall verify 
that the key management information is related to the 
targeted user. 
A timer may be defined in the DF2/MF in order to specify the amount of time that the DF2/MF shall wait for the 
response from the KMS. If this timer expires, a failure indication shall be sent to the LEMF. 
Table 7A.7.2.2 provides the list of parameters, which shall be carried by the message get_keys_response, in order to 
provide the DF2/MF with the session keys: 
Table 7A.7.2.2: Parameters and information in message get_keys_response 
Crypto Session ID 
Session key 
Salt 
Failure indication (optional) 
 
With reference to table 7A.7.2.2, in case of failure in providing any of the decryption information, the KMS may 

provide a decryption failure indication. 
Upon reception of get_keys_response message or in case of ti
mer expiry, the following information shall be provided to 
the LEMF by the DF2/MF: 
- Lawful interception identifier 

- Observed target identity(ies) 

- Correlation number (in order to correlate the keys to IMS session under interception at the CSCF(s)) 

- Event type (session encryption keys available) 
- Crypto Session ID (if provided by the KMS) 
- Session key (if provided by the KMS) 

- Salt (if provided by the KMS) 

- MediaSec key retrieval failure indication (in case of e.g.
 timer expiry, or failure indication received from the 
KMS). 7A.7.3 Cooperating KMSs 
As specified in TS 33.328 [25], in some scenarios the pa
rties involved in an encrypted IMS based communication may 
use two different KMSs. In these cases, no additional LI sp
ecific signalling between the KMSs shall take place. The 
KMS may need to cache the session keys retrieved as result of
 the ticket resolution for possible LI needs at later stage. 
7A.7.4 Security 
Xk interface and its configuration shall only be accessible to authorized personnel. 

The Xk interface shall have strong integrity and confidentialit
y protection. The Xk interface shall be protected by TLS 
unless protected by IPsec for LI purposes. TLS and certificate profiling shall be according to TS 33.310 [28]; IPsec 
profiling shall be according to TS 33.310 [28] and TS 33.210 [29].

7A.7.5 Start of interception for an 
already established IMS media secured 
session 
This function is invoked when LI is activated in the network for a target who has already established an IMS session 
with secure media. 
In order to provide information needed 
to decrypt the content of communication, 
the LI function in the CSCFs needs to 
have access to SDP information and SIP headers exchanged in the SIP signalling between the parties during the IMS 
session setup for possible later retrieval in case LI is activated during the ongoing session. 
With reference to fig. 7A.7.1, if LI is
 activated by the ADMF over the X1_1 interface for a target, the CSCF shall check 
if the given target has an ongoing IMS media secured session. In this case, the CSCF shall provide a "Start of 

interception with established IMS session" event message to 
the DF2/MF over the X2 interface, as specified in section 
7A.3.1. 
Upon reception of Start of in
terception with established IMS secure session event, the DF2/MF shall check if a 
MIKEY-TICKET is included in the SDP. In this case the DF2/MF, in addition to forwarding the event to the LEMF 

over HI2, shall contact the KMS to resolve the ticket and retrieve the session keys and additional encryption related 

information as specified in in section 7A.7.2. 
7A.8 IMS IMEI Interception 
The use of Instance ID in TS 24.229 [49] is mandatory in IMS in order to support IMEI based LI in the CSCF. The 

CSCF is required to have access to the Instance IDs for all 
active IMS registrations regardless of whether LI has been 
requested prior to UE registration for a given IMEI. The CSCF shall be responsible for extracting the IMEI from the 

Instance ID where required for a specific target intercep
tion and providing the IMEI to the DF2. The IMEI (when 
available) shall be provided by the CSCF to the DF2 for 
all intercepted communication regardless of whether the IMEI 
or another identifier has been used as the target for interception. 
Based on the national regulations, IMEI-based LI shall be possible for IMS sessions originated from, or terminated to, 
the UE with that IMEI. 
7A.9 Constraints for IMS VoIP Roaming Interception 
National regulations may limit delivery of communications (CC and communications-associated IRI) of an outbound 

international roaming target by the HPLMN as described in clause 5.1.4 of TS 33.106 [7]. 
If roaming interception is allowed, 
IMS VoIP interception and delivery to the LEMF by the HPLMN shall proceed 
normally as described elsewhere in this specification when th
e target is roaming outside the country as well as when the 
target is within the country. 
If roaming interception is not allowed and it is determined that the target is outside the country, the HPLMN shall act as 
follows: 
The HPLMN shall report IRI and CC for IMS VoIP sessions where the target is not participating in the IMS VoIP 
services which can be the result of the activation, invoca
tion, or operation of any supplemental services that are 
performed entirely by the HPLMN. This can include invocation before an IMS VoIP session, at the beginning of an 

IMS VoIP session, mid IMS VoIP session, or at the end of an IMS VoIP session. Examples of such supplemental 

services include diversion services such as call forwarding (a
ll calls, busy calls, etc.). Services where the target is still 
participating in the IMS VoIP session would not be reported (e.g., call hold, conferencing).

8 Security 
8.0 General 
The security requirements are valid for the whole Lawful Interception system, i.e. rules and procedures shall be used for 
all involved entities, such as 3G GSN and the DF. 
8.1 Administration security 
The administration of the LI function, i.e. Activation, D
eactivation and Interrogation of Lawful Interception, in the 
3G ICEs and the DFs shall be done securely as described below: 
- It shall be possible to configure the authorised user 
access within the serving network to Activate, Deactivate and 
Interrogate Lawful Interception separately for every physical
 or logical port at the 3G ICEs and DF. It shall be 
possible to password protect user access. 
- Only the ADMF is allowed to have access to the LI functionality in the 3G ICEs and DF. 
- The communication links between ADMF, 3G GSN, 3G MSC Servers or any ICEs of this specification, LI LCS 
Client, CSCF, DF2, and DF3 may be required by national option to support security mechanisms. Options for 
security mechanisms include: 
- CUG / VPN; 
- COLP; 

- CLIP; 

- authentication; 
- encryption. 
Through the use of user access restrictions, no unauthorised network entities or remote equipment shall be able to view 
or manipulate LI data in the 3G GSN, 3G MSC Server, LI LCS Client, CSCF, 3GPP ICE, any 3GPP nodes, and 

Administration nodes of this specification or the DFs. 
8.2 IRI security 
8.2.1 Normal operation 
The transmission of the IRI shall be done in a secure manner. 
When DFs are physically separate from the 3G ICEs or any nodes described in this specification for IRI creations, the 
X2-interface may be required by natio
nal option to support security mechanis
ms. Options for security mechanisms 
include: 
- CUG/VPN; 
- COLP; 

- CLIP; 

- authentication; 

- encryption. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)783GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
8.2.2 Communication failure 
Depending on the national law in case of communication failure IRI may be buffered in the 3G INEs or other node 
elements used in this specification. After successful transmis
sion of IRI the whole buffer shall be deleted. It shall be 
possible to delete the content buffer via command or a timer, in an un-restorable fashion. 
8.3 CC security 
The transmission of the CC shall be done in a secure manner. 
When DFs are physically separate from the 3G INEs or any other nodes used for interception mentioned in this 
specification, the X3-interface may be required by national option to support security mechanisms. Options for security 

mechanisms include: 
- CUG/VPN; 
- COLP; 
- CLIP; 

- authentication; 

- encryption. 
In case of transmission failure no buffering 
is required within the intercepting network. 
8.4 Security aspects of Lawf
ul Interception (LI) billing 
Billing information may be suppressed or made available at
 the DFs and the ADMF. Billing information for Lawful 
Interception shall be separated from "regular" billing data. 

Billing data transmission to the Lawful Interception billing system may be done in a secure manner per national option. 
In case of transmission failure billing-data shall be buffered/stored in a secure way. After successful transmission billing 
data shall be deleted in an un-restorable fashion. 
8.5 Other security issues 
8.5.1 Log files 
Log files shall be generated by the ADMF, DF2, DF3, 3G MSC Servers, or any 3GPP nodes of this specification, LI 
LCS Client, CSCF and the 3G GSN. All log files are retrievable by the ADMF, and are maintained by the ADMF in a 
secure manner. 
8.5.2 Data consistency 
The administration function in the 3GMS or any nodes described in this specification shall be capable of performing a 

periodic consistency check to ensure that the target list of ta
rget identities in all involved 3G MSC Servers or any 3GPP 
nodes of this specification, LI LCS Client, CSCFs, 3G GSNs in the 3GMS and the DFs contain the appropriate target 

Ids consistent with the intercept orders in the ADMF. The reference data base is the ADMF data base.

9 Invocation of Lawful Interception (LI) for 3GPP 
WLAN interworking services 
9.0 General 
WLAN Interworking specifications (TS 23.234 [14], TS 24.234 [17] and TS 29.234 [16]) are no longer maintained for 
Release 12 onwards. 
This clause 9 is therefore no longer maintained.

   Figure 23: Functional model for invocation of Lawful Interception for 3GPP WLAN Interworking 
Services 
The HI2 and HI3 interfaces represent the interfaces between the LEA and two delivery functions. Both interfaces are 
subject to national requirements. They ar
e included for completeness, but are beyond the scope of this specification. 
The delivery functions are used: 
- to convert the information on the X2-interface to 
the corresponding information on the HI2 interface; 
- to distribute the intercept related information to the relevant LEA(s); 
- to distribute the intercept product to the relevant LEA(s). 
Interception at a WAG applies for the roaming user
s where the PDG is not in the visited network. 
For most WLAN Interworking cases, the Packet Data Gatewa
y (PDG) handles the bearer le
vel interception, specifically 
interception of CC and IRI related to tunnel establishment and release in which case there is no need to perform 
interception at a WAG. This includes the case where the P
DG is in the intercepting carrier's network (whether it be 
home or visited). For the case where a visited network is to
 intercept WLAN related tunnel and the PDG for the tunnel 
is not in the visited network, the Wireless Access Gateway (W
AG) is used to intercept the CC and IRI related to tunnel 
establishment and release. It should be noted that
 the CC available at the WAG may be encrypted.

9.2.0 General 
The access method for the delivering of 3GPP WLAN Interworking
 Intercept Product is based on duplication of packets 
without modification at the PDG or WAG. The duplicated packets with additional information in the header, as 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)803GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
described in the following sections, are sent to DF3 for further delivery. Note that CC available at the WAG is likely to 
be encrypted.

In addition to the intercepted content of communications, the following information needs to be transferred from the 
PDG or WAG to the DF3 in order to allow the DF3 to perform its functionality: 
- target identity; 
- correlation number; 

- time stamp - optional; 
- direction (indicates whether T-PDU is MO or MT) - optional; 
- the target location (if available in the intercepting node). 
9.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information 
9.3.0 General 
Figure 25 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If an event for / from a mobile subscriber 
occurs, the PDG, WAG, or the AAA Server sends the releva
nt data to the DF2. Packet Data Header Information 
reporting is a national option. For Packet Data Header Info
rmation reporting, a PDG/WAG either isolates the relevant 
data and sends it to the DF2 or sends the packet stream to another entity in the network (e.g., DF3) for isolation which 

then provides the relevant data to the DF2.

The following information needs to be transferred from the PDG, WAG or the AAA server to the DF2 in order to allow 
a DF2 to perform its functionality: 
- target identity (IMSI, NAI, or MSISDN); 
- events and associated parameters as defined in section 9.3.2 may be provided; 
- the target location (if available); 

- Correlation number; 

- Quality of Service (QoS) identifier (if available). 
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism. 
The PDG/WAG detects packets containing packet data h
eader information in the communications path but the 
information needed for Packet Data H
eader Information reporting may need to be transferred from the PDG/WAG 
either directly to the DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. 
9.3.2 3GPP WLAN Interworking LI Events and Event Information 
The following events are applicable to AAA Server: 
- I-WLAN Access Initiation; 
- I-WLAN re-authentication, 

- I-WLAN Access Termination; 
- I-WLAN Tunnel Establishment; 
- I-WLAN Tunnel Disconnect; 

- Start of Intercept with I-WLAN Communication Active; 
The following events are applicable to the PDG and WAG: 
- I-WLAN Tunnel Establishment; 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017

- I-WLAN Tunnel Disconnect; 
- Start of Intercept with I-WLAN Communication Active. 

- Packet Data Header Information. 
A set of possible elements as shown below is used to genera
te the events. Information associated with the events are 
transmitted from the PDG, WAG or AAA server to DF2. 
NOTE: Void. 
Some of these parameters apply to the PDG or WAG and some apply to the AAA server. Parameters sent from the 
PDG, WAG or AAA server is dependent on what is available at the network element. If interception is performed at the 

PDG, then Packet Data Header Information reporting shall also be performed at the PDG and not at the WAG.

 9.4.6.2 Packet Data Summary Report 
This event is used to report: 
1) the source and destination information derived from the packet headers, including: 
a) source and destination IP Addresses, 
b) IP next-layer protocol, 

c) Layer-4 ports, and 

d) Flow label, if the packet is IPv6 
2) summary information for the number of packets and bytes transmitted or received by the target for each unique 
packet flow within a WLAN tunnel, and 
3) the date and the time of the first and last packets associated with that packet flow. A packet flow is defined as the 
6-tuple of source/destination IP address/port number and the layer 4 protocol and WLAN tunnel. 

IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always re
ported, the flow label is reported if the packet is IPv6, 
and the layer-4 ports are reported. 
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique p
acket data session (PDP context) and packet flow, and is 
triggered by one of the following: 
- start of a packet flow associated with a WLAN Tunnel 

- an interim report for a packet flow associated with a WLAN Tunnel is to be reported 

- end of a packet flow associated with a WLAN 
Tunnel (including end of the WLAN Tunnel itself). 
An interim report can be triggered by 
- The expiration of a configurable timer per inter
cept (called a Summary Timer). The Summary Timer is 
configurable in units of seconds; 
- A per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached. 
These elements will be delivered either directly to 
DF2 or via an MF for each packet flow if available:

10 Interception of Multimedia Broadcast/MultiCast 
Service (MBMS) 
10.0 General 
MBMS provides video or similar streamed services via either point to point multicast or cell broadcast mechanisms 
between an operator content server (BM-SC) and UEs as defined in TS 23.246 [20]. This section details the stage 2 

Lawful Interception requirements for MBMS. 
NOTE: Generic Broadcast services where the UE receives the broadcast in IDLE mode and there is no 
subscription relationship between the UE and the BM-SC are out of scope. In addition 3
rd party BM-SC 
services where the operator is not responsible for content encryption and subscription management are 

out of scope. 
Figure 10.1 shows the extract from the reference configuration which is relevant for the invocation of the Lawful 

Interception of the MBMS Services.

 11 IMS Conference Services 
11.1 Background for IMS Conference Services 
The entire clause 11 is a national option and is subject 
to national regulations. The covered cases are where the 
conference services are in the domain of the inter
cepting operator. The following cases are covered. 
1. A target's conference call is the target. This may be where the target is the head of the conference. IRI and CC 
for this conference is reported. The following are examples of information that is reported. 
a. For example, the starting and ending of a conference as well as any parties joined or removed from the 
conference call are reported. 
b. Reporting of CC for held conferences initiated by the target. 
2. A conference that itself is directly the target of inte
rception. This case is applicab
le only provided that the 
conference is identified by a proper identity for LI in IMS domain (Conference URI or Conference Factory 

URI). The IRI and CC for this conference is reported. 
a. For example, the starting and ending or a conference 
as well as any parties joined or removed from the 
conference call are reported. 
The case when an target joins an associate's conference is for further study. 
The key elements for interception of conference services
 are the AS/MRFC and MRFP. IRI associated with the 
conference services that are to be intercepted is reported 
by the AS/MRFC while the CC associated with the conference 
service is reported by the MRFP. 
11.1A Start of Interception for IMS Conference Services 
Interception (as defined in 11.1) for IMS Conference Services is started when the first of any one of the following 
occurs: 
- When a target requests that a conference be created 
- When a target successfully provisions a conference 

- When a target provisioned or requested conference is started (i.e., the first party is joined to the conference) 

- When a conference that is a target of interception is 
started (i.e., the first party is joined to the conference) 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1013GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
- When interception is activated (on a conference or
 a conference owner) during an ongoing conference 
- When parties have joined a conference and communicatio
n is started or enabled by the conference server in 
cases where the conference is a target of inte
rception or when it is a target's conference. 
If the target of interception has provisioned or requeste
d a conference to be created, 
interception on IMS Conference 
Services shall begin regardless whether the target of interception has joined the conference. Interception of IMS 
Conference Services shall continue if the target of 
interception is on hold an
d the conference continues. 
11.2 Provision of Intercepted Content of Communication - IMS 
Conference Services 
11.2.0 General 
The access method for the delivery of IMS conference services intercept content of communication (CC) is based on 

duplication of packets without modification at the MRFP for 
conferences that are to be 
intercepted. The duplicated 
packets with additional information in the header, as described in the following sections, are sent to DF3 for further 

delivery. For a target's conference call held by the target, the MRFP duplicates the CC for conference call held by the 
target, in accordance with national regulations. For a confer
ence call that is the target of interception, the MRFP 
duplicates the CC for the conference. 
NOTE: Void 
There is an issue of combined versus separated delivery. With combined delivery, one method for intercepting the CC 

would be to create a virtual conference port (not visible to others) through which a copy of the combined CC is passed 

over the X3 interface (Y conferees means 1 content stream
). With the separated delivery approach, each conferee's 
connection to the conference shall be intercepted and passed over the X3 interface (Y conferees, means Y pairs of bi-

directional content streams).

In addition to the intercepted content of communications, the following information may need to be transferred from the 

MRFP to the DF3 in order to allow the DF3 to perform its functionality: 
- identity used for interception; 
- correlation number. 
NOTE 1: Void. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1023GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
Information passed between the MRFC and MRFP for correlation shall uniquely identify the mixing of associated 
media streams for a conference distinct from any other mixing or media handling. An example is how H.248 uses a 

context identifier to do this. 
- the identity of source (i.e., conference party identity) of a media stream; 
- time stamp - optional; 

- direction (incoming or outgoing stream) - optional. 
NOTE 2: When the media is delivered in a mixed format, the identity of the media stream source might be 
unknown. 
11.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information for IMS 
Conference Service 
11.3.0 General 
Figure 11.2 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If an event for / from or associated with a 
conference server occurs, the AS/MRFC sends the relevant data to the DF2. 
NOTE: Reporting of non-transmission related actions of a target's subscriber controlled input (e.g., signalling 
"mute" commands) is for further study.

 The definition of the LI functional entities (ADMF, DF, MF
, LEMF) and interfaces (X, HI) is the same as for 3G as 
given in chapter 4. Packet Header Information Reporting is
 a national option. For Packet
 Data Header Information 
reporting, a S-GW/PDN-GW either isolates the relevant data and sends it to the DF2 or sends the packet stream to 
another entity in the network (e.g., DF3) for isolation which then provides the relevant data to the DF2. 
Procedures for LI activation, deactivation and interrogation are 
the same as for 3G as given in chapter 5, provided that: 
- the 3G ICE is replaced by the EPS node; 

- the proper target identity applicable to EPS node is used. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1133GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
When the SGSN is used as node in the Evolved Packet System, to support 2G/3G access and mobility between E-
UTRAN and pre-E-UTRAN 3GPP radio access technologies, it is subjected to all the related PS requirements specified 

throughout this document. 
Figure 12.1.1a depicts how the HeNB location information is transferred from the HeNB location verifying node per 
TS 33.320 [34] to the DF2 via an Xv interface, in order to allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. The public IP 

Address of the HeNB is provided to the HeNB location verifying node. The manner that the HeNB location verifying 
node provides the DF2 with the HeNB location and HeNB IP Address is outside the scope of this document. Additional 
information on HeNB interception is found in Clause 13. 
Figure 12.1.4 depicts the LI configuration for SGW and PGW with PLMN implementing CUPS (see 3GPP TS 23.214 
[75]). This is described in subclause 12.9. The Sxa™ and SXb™ are the LI specific instances of Sxa and Sxb reference 

points.  
The target identities for 3GPP HeNB interception can be IMSI, MSISDN, IMEI, or ME Id. Use of the HeNB ID or the 
CSG ID as a target identity is FFS. 
12.2 Functional requirements for LI in case of E-UTRAN access 
and GTP based S5/S8. 
12.2.0 General 
The target identities for interception at the MME, HSS, S-GW , PDN-GW and LI LCS Client are IMSI, MSISDN and 

ME (Mobile Equipment) Identity. 
NOTE 1: Void. 
Details about information included in the ME Identity and the relationship with IMEI needs to be considered. The term 

Mobile Equipment Identity is used in this
 text according to TS 23.401 [22] so as
 to indicate that the EPC should support 
multiple equipment identity formats (e.g. those from 3GPP2, WiMAX, etc) as well as the IMEISV. 
NOTE 2: In case of local breakout the PDN Gateway is in the VPLMN. In this case LI relevant information in the 
H-PLMN might be available at the H-PCRF. Interception at the H-PCRF is FFS. 
NOTE 3: In case the ME Identity and/or MSISDN is not available in a node, interception based on the missing 
identity is not applicable at that node. 
NOTE 4: MSISDN is a possible identity available in the EPC nodes, which may be provided by the HSS to the 
MME and then forwarded to the S-GW/PDN-GW. 
As the MME only handles control plane, interception of Cont
ent of Communication is applicable only at the S-GW and 
PDN-GW. As the HSS only handles signaling, interception of Content of Communication is not applicable at this node. 
LI in the PDN-GW is a national option. 
For the delivery of the CC and IRI the S-GW and/or, per national option PDN-GW provides correlation number and 
target identity to the DF2 and DF3 which is used there in or
der to select the different LEAs where the product shall be 
delivered. 
The correlation number is unique in the whole PLMN and is us
ed to correlate CC with IRI and the different IRI's of one 
EPS bearer. 
The correlation number shall be generated by using existing parameters related to the EPS bearer. 
NOTE 5: Void. 
If interception has been activated for both parties of the Packet Data communication both CC and IRI shall be delivered 
for each party as separate intercept activity. 
Editor's note: Location Dependent Interception for EPC is FFS. 
NOTE 6: For LALS, any UE (including inbound roamers) served by the PLMN can be targeted. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017

12.2.1 Provision of Intercept Related Information 
12.2.1.0 General 
Intercept Related Information (Events) shall be sent at the Mobile Entity Attach, Mobile Entity Detach, Tracking 
Area/EPS Location Update, LALS Location Report, Bearer ac
tivation (valid for both Default and Dedicated bearer), 
Start of Intercept with bearer active, 
Start of Interception with E-UTRAN atta
ched UE, Bearer Modification, Bearer 
Deactivation, Serving Evolved Packet System (applicable to the HSS), UE requested PDN connectivity, UE requested 
PDN disconnection, and UE requested bearer resource modification. 
Serving Evolved Packet System and HSS related events event reporting are national options. 
12.2.1.1 X2-interface 
The following information needs to be transferred from the EPS nodes or the HSS to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to 
perform its functionality: 
- target identity (IMSI, MSISDN, ME identity); 
- events and associated parameters as defined in clause 12.2.1.2 and 12.2.3 may be provided; 

- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent interception; 

- correlation number; 
- Quality of Service (QoS) information (if available); 
- encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC), if available and necessary. 
For HeNB interception, the MME shall provide in addition the following: 
- HeNB Identity; 

- HeNB location. 

HeNB location information needs to be transferred from the HeNB location verifying node to the DF2 in order to 
allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. 
The EPS nodes detect packets containing packet header in
formation in the communications path but the information 
needed for Packet Header Information Reporting may need to 
be transferred from the EPS nodes either directly to the 
DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. 

The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism. 
12.2.1.2 Structure of the events 
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2 if this is required. Details are described in 
the following clause. The events for interception are configurab
le (if they are sent to DF2) in the EPC nodes or the HSS 
and can be suppressed in the DF2. The network procedures for which the events are generated are defined in 
TS 23.401 [22]. 
The following events are 
applicable to the MME: 
- Attach; 
- Detach; 
- Tracking Area/EPS Location Update; 

- UE requested PDN connectivity; 

- UE Requested PDN disconnection; 

- Start of interception with E-UTRAN attached UE. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1153GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
The following events are applicable
 to the Serving GW and PDN GW:
 - Bearer activation (valid for both Default and Dedicated bearer); 
- Start of intercept with bearer active; 

- Bearer modification; 

- Bearer deactivation; 

- UE Requested Bearer Resource Modification; 
- Packet Data Header Information. 
The following events are 
applicable to the HSS: 
- Serving Evolved Packet System. 
- HSS subscriber record change; 

- Cancel location 
- Register location; 
- Location information request. 
The following LALS Reports 
are applicable to the EPS
 (see Clause 19): 
- Report for LALS Target Positioning; 

- Report for LALS Enhanced Location for IRI. 
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events trigger the transmission of the 
information from the nodes to DF2. Available IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the 
nodes, if this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information if this is necessary as a national 

option. If interception is performed at the PDN GW, then 
Packet Data Header Information reporting shall also be 
performed at the PDN GW and not at the Serving GW. 
A number of elements shown below can be also associated with the LALS reports. The transmission of the information 
from the LI LCS Client to DF2 is triggered by an LCS Server/GMLC response to the LI LCS Client request.

 12.2.3.14.2 Packet Data Summary Report 
This event is used to report: 
1) the source and destination information derived from the packet headers, including: 
a) source and destination IP Addresses, 
b) IP next-layer protocol, 

c) Layer-4 ports, and 

d) Flow label, if the packet is IPv6 
2) summary information for the number of packets and bytes transmitted or received by the target for each unique 
packet flow within an EPS bearer, and 
3) the date and the time of the first and last packets associated with that packet flow. A packet flow is defined as the 
6-tuple of source/destination IP address/port number and the layer 4 protocol and EPS bearer. 

IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always re
ported, the flow label is reported if the packet is IPv6, 
and the layer-4 ports are reported. 
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique p
acket data session (EPS bearer) and packet flow, and is 
triggered by one of the following: 
- start of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer 

- an interim report for a packet flow associat
ed with an EPS bearer is to be reported 
- end of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer (including end of the EPS bearer itself).

 12.3 Functional requirements for LI in case of E-UTRAN access 
and PMIP based S5/S8 interfaces 
12.3.0 General 
Functional requirements for LI in the MME, S-GW, LI LCS Client and HSS do not differ from the ones applicable to 
the case of GTP based S5-S8 interfaces, as specified in clause 12.2 and subclauses. 
LI in the PDN-GW is a national option. 

Interception in the PDN-GW and in the LI LCS Client shall be based on one or more of NAI, MSISDN, IMEI. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1293GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
For the delivery of the CC and IRI, the PDN-GW provides co
rrelation number and target identity to the DF2 and DF3 
which is used there in order to select the different LEAs where the product shall be delivered. 
The correlation number is unique in the whole PLMN and is us
ed to correlate CC with IRI and the different IRI's of one 
IP-CAN session. However, when different protocols (i.e. GTP and PMIP) are used in the network, different values can 
be generated by different nodes. 
The correlation number shall be generated by using existing parameters related to the IP-CAN session. 
NOTE: Void 
If interception has been activated for both parties of the Packet Data communication both CC and IRI shall be delivered 
for each party as separate intercept activity. 
12.3.1 Provision of intercept related information 
12.3.1.0 General 
Intercept Related Information (Events) shall be sent at attach/tunnel activation, detach/tunnel deactivation, start of 

interception with active PMIP tunnel, PMIP session modification, PDN-GW initiated PDN-disconnection, UE requested 

PDN connectivity, Serving Evolved Packet System, subscr
iber record change, registration termination, location 
information request , and LALS Location Report. 
LI based on HSS reporting is a national option. Requirements on the HSS specified in section 12.2 and subsections 
apply also to the case in which S5/S8 interfaces are PMIP based. 
12.3.1.1 X2 interface 
The following information needs to be transferred from the PDN-GW to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its 

functionality: 
- target identity; 
- events and associated parameters as defined in clause 12.3.1.2 and 12.3.3 may be provided; 
- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent interception; (FFS) 

- correlation number; 

- Quality of Service (QoS) information, if available; 

- encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC), if available and necessary. 
The PDN-GW detect packets containing packet data header 
information in the communications path but the information 
needed for Packet Data Header Information reporting may need to be transferred from the PDN-GW either directly to 
the DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. 
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism. 

For the LALS Reports the following information needs to be transferred from the LI LCS Client to the DF2 in order to 
allow a DF2 to perform its functionality: 
- target identities; 
- the target location (if available); 

- error code (if positioning fails); 

- Correlation Identifier (in the case of report for Enhanced Location for IRI). 
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.

12.3.1.2 Structure of the events 
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2 if this is required. The events for 
interception are configurable (if they are sent to DF2) in
 the PDN-GW, LI LCS Client and can be suppressed in the 
DF2. The network procedures for which the events are generated are defined in TS 23.402 [23]. 
The following events are ap
plicable to the PDN-GW: 
- PMIP Attach/tunnel activation; 
- PMIP Detach/tunnel deactivation; 
- PMIP session modification 
- Start of interception with active PMIP tunnel; 

- PMIP PDN-GW initiated PDN-disconnection; 

- Packet Data Header Information. 
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events trigger the transmission of the 
information from the nodes to DF2. Available IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the 
nodes, if this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information if this is necessary as a national 

option.

 12.3.3.7.2 Packet Data Summary Report 
This event is used to report: 
1) the source and destination information derived from the packet headers, including: 
a) source and destination IP Addresses, 
b) IP next-layer protocol, 

c) Layer-4 ports, and 

d) Flow label, if the packet is IPv6 
2) summary information for the number of packets and bytes transmitted or received by the target for each unique 
packet flow within an EPS bearer, and 
3) the date and the time of the first and last packets associated with that packet flow. A packet flow is defined as the 
6-tuple of source/destination IP address/port number and the layer 4 protocol and EPS bearer. 
 IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always re
ported, the flow label is reported if the packet is IPv6, 
and the layer-4 ports are reported. 
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique p
acket data session (EPS bearer) and packet flow, and is 
triggered by one of the following: 
- start of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer 

- an interim report for a packet flow associat
ed with an EPS bearer is to be reported 
- end of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer (including end of the EPS bearer itself). 
An interim report can be triggered by 
- The expiration of a configurable timer per inter
cept (called a Summary Timer). The Summary Timer is 
configurable in units of seconds; 
- A per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached. 
These elements will be delivered either directly to
 DF2 or via DF3 for each packet flow if available:

Packet Summary Reason 
 If the packets are IPv4, the sum of all observed packet sizes is the sum of the values contained in the Total Length field 

of each packet as specified in IETF RFC 791[39]. 
If the packet is IPv6, the sum of all observed packet sizes is the sum of the values contained in the Payload Length field 
for each packet as specified in IETF RFC 2460 [40]. 
If no packets were detected for the duration of the Summary Timer, then the Packet Data Summary Report shall not be 
sent. 
12.4 Functional requirements for LI
 in case of trusted non-3GPP 
IP access 
12.4.0 General 
Differently to what happens in E-UTRAN case, in which the user traffic passes through the S-GW and then through the 

PDN-GW, there are two cases of access to the network throu
gh S2a (trusted Non-3GPP access) that require additional 
consideration. Specifically, the PDN-GW 
is the only possible ICE in the 3GPP network in the case of non-roaming 

(PDN-GW in the HPLMN) and in the case of roaming wi
th local breakout (PDN-GW is located in the VPLMN) 
Therefore, in these cases, intercep
tion at the PDN-GW is required. 
LI based on HSS reporting is a national option. Requirements on the HSS specified in clause7A.2 and subsections apply 

also to the case in which non-3GPP IP access and 3GPP AAA 
server are based. Intercept Related Information (Events) 
are in such case: serving system, subscriber record change, 
registration termination, and location information request.In 

case of access to the network through S2a (trusted Non-3G
PP access) for roaming without local breakout (PDN-GW in 
the HPLMN and S-GW in the VPLMN), interception at the PDN-GW is a national option. 
Interception in the S-GW and PDN-GW shall be based on IMSI or NAI. 
NOTE 1: The NAI may be a temporary ID, therefore the use of IMSI is recommended. 
For the delivery of the CC and IRI, the S-GW and/or PDN-GW 
provides correlation number and target identity to the 
DF2 and DF3 which is used there in order to select th
e different LEAs where the product shall be delivered. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1383GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
The correlation number is unique in the whole PLMN and is us
ed to correlate CC with IRI and the different IRI's of one 
IP-CAN session. However, when different protocols (i.e. GTP and PMIP) are used in the network, different values can 
be generated by different nodes 
The correlation number shall be generated by using existing parameters related to the IP-CAN session. 
NOTE 2: Void. 
If interception has been activated for both parties of the Packet Data communication both CC and IRI shall be delivered 
for each party as separate intercept activity. 
12.4.1 Provision of Intercept Related Information 
12.4.1.0 General 
Intercept Related Information (Events) shall be sent at 
attach/tunnel activation on interfaces s2a and s2c, session 
modification, detach/tunnel deactivation, start of intercep
tion with active tunnel, PDN-GW reallocation upon initial 
attach on s2c, PDN GW initiated resource allocation Deactivation on s2a, Serving Evolved Packet System. 
Serving Evolved Packet System reporting is a national option. 
12.4.1.1 X2-interface 
The following information needs to be transferred from the S-GW, PDN-GW or the HSS to the DF2 in order to allow a 
DF2 to perform its functionality: 
- target identity; 
- events and associated parameters as defined in clause 12.4.1.2 and 12.4.3 may be provided; 

- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent interception; (FFS) 

- correlation number; 

- Quality of Service (QoS) information, if available; 
- encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC), if available and necessary. 
The PDN-GW/S-GW detect packets cont
aining packet header information in the communications path but the 
information needed for Packet Data H
eader Information Reporting may need to be transferred from the PDN-GW/S-
GW either directly to the DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. 
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism. 
12.4.1.2 Structure of the events 
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2 if this is required. The events for 
interception are configurable (if they are sent to DF2) in
 the S-GW, PDN-GW or the HSS and can be suppressed in the 
DF2. 
The following events are 
applicable to the S-GW: 
- PMIP attach/tunnel activation; 
- PMIP detach/tunnel deactivation; 
- PMIP session modification; 
- Start of interception with active PMIP tunnel; 

- Packet Data Header Information. 
The following events are ap
plicable to the PDN-GW: 
- PMIP attach/tunnel activation; 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1393GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
- PMIP detach/tunnel deactivation; 
- PMIP session modification; 

- Start of interception with active PMIP tunnel; 

- MIP registration/tunnel activation; 

- DSMIP registration/tunnel activation; 

- DSMIP session modification; 
- MIP deregistration/tunnel deactivation; 
- DSMIP deregistration/tunnel deactivation; 

- Start of interception with active MIP tunnel; 

- Start of interception with active DSMIP tunnel; 

- DSMIP HA Switch; 
- PMIP Resource Allocation Deactivation; 
- MIP Resource Allocation Deactivation; 

- Bearer activation; 

- Bearer deactivation; 

- Bearer modification; 

- Start of interceptio
n with active bearer; 
- Packet Data Header Information. 

NOTE: Bearer activation, bear
er deactivation, bearer modification and st
art of interception wi
th active bearer are 
applicable to trusted non-3GPP access when the GTP protocol is used over s2a interface as specified in 
TS 23.402 [23]. 
The following event is applicable to the HSS, which may be requested by national regulations: 
 - Serving Evolved Packet System; 
 - Subscriber record change; 
 - Registration termination; 

 - Location information request. 
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events trigger the transmission of the 
information from the nodes to DF2. Available IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the 

nodes, if this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information if this is necessary as a national 
option. In case GTP protocol is used over s2a interface, el
ements from table 12.2.1.2 are included in the applicable 
events. If interception is performed at the PDN GW, then Packet Data Header Information reporting shall also be 
performed at the PDN GW and not at the Serving GW.

 12.4.3.17.2 Packet Data Summary Report 
This event is used to report: 
1) the source and destination information derived from the packet headers, including: 
a) source and destination IP Addresses, 
b) IP next-layer protocol, 
c) Layer-4 ports, and 
d) Flow label, if the packet is IPv6 
2) summary information for the number of packets and bytes transmitted or received by the target for each unique 
packet flow within an EPS bearer, and 
3) the date and the time of the first and last packets associated with that packet flow. A packet flow is defined as the 
6-tuple of source/destination IP address/port number and the layer 4 protocol and EPS bearer. 
 IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always re
ported, the flow label is reported if the packet is IPv6, 
and the layer-4 ports are reported. 
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique p
acket data session (EPS bearer) and packet flow, and is 
triggered by one of the following: 
- start of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer 
- an interim report for a packet flow associat
ed with an EPS bearer is to be reported 
- end of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer (including end of the EPS bearer itself). 
An interim report can be triggered by 
- The expiration of a configurable timer per inter
cept (called a Summary Timer). The Summary Timer is 
configurable in units of seconds; 
- A per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached. 
These elements will be delivered either directly to th
e DF2 or via a MF for each packet flow if available:

 12.5 Functional requirements for LI in case of untrusted non-
3GPP IP access 
12.5.0 Introduction 
This clause specifies functional requirements applicable to the PDN-GW and HSS. In addition, this clause specifies 
requirements applicable to the ePDG in case this node is 
using a GTPv2 based protocol over s2b interface as specified 
in TS 23.402 [23]. 
The e-PDG not using a GTPv2 based protocol over s2b interface and the AAA server are subjected to all the 
requirements specified in this document for PDG and AAA server for the case of I-WLAN interworking. 
NOTE 1: WLAN Interworking specifications (TS 23.234 [14], TS 24.234 [17] and TS 29.234 [16]) are no longer 
maintained for Release 12 onwards. This clause is therefore no longer maintained for WLAN 

Interworking. 
Interception in the PDN-GW is a national option. 
Interception in the PDN-GW shall be based on IMSI or NAI. In case of GTPv2 based protocol, interception at the ePDG 
and PDN-GW shall be based on IMSI. 
NOTE 2: The NAI may be a temporary ID, therefore the use of IMSI is recommended. 
For the delivery of the CC and IRI, the PDN-GW and ePDG prov
ides correlation number and target identity to the DF2 
and DF3 which is used there in order to select the 
different LEAs where the product shall be delivered. 
LI based on HSS reporting is a national option. Requirements on the HSS specified in clause 7A.2 and subsections 
apply also to the case in which non-3GPP IP access and 3GPP AAA server are based. Intercept Related Information 

(Events) are serving system, subscriber record change, re
gistration termination, and location information request. 
12.5.1 Provision of Intercept Related Information 
12.5.1.0 General 
Intercept Related Information (Events) shall be sent at a
ttach/tunnel activation on interfaces s2b and s2c, detach/tunnel 
deactivation, session modification, start of interceptio
n with active tunnel, Serving Evolved Packet System. 
In case of GTPv2 based s2b, Intercept Related Information 
shall be sent at attach/bearer activation, detach/bearer 
deactivation, bearer modification and st
art of interception with active bearer. 
The following event is applicable to the HSS, which is a national option: 
- Serving Evolved Packet System; 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1533GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
- Subscriber record change; 
- Registration termination; 

- Location information request. 
12.5.1.1 X2-interface 
The following information needs to be transferred from the PDN-GW, ePDG or the HSS to the DF2 in order to allow a 
DF2 to perform its functionality: 
- target identity; 
- events and associated parameters as defined in clause 12.5.1.2 and 12.5.3 may be provided; 
- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent interception; (FFS) 

- correlation number; 

- Quality of Service (QoS) information, if available; 

- encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC), if available and necessary. 
The PDN-GW detect packets containing packet header in
formation in the communications path but the information 
needed for Packet Data Header Information reporting may need to be transferred from the PDN-GW either directly to 
the DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. 
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism. 
12.5.1.2 Structure of the events 
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2 if this is required. The events for 
interception are configurable (if they are sent to DF2) in
 the PDN-GW, ePDG or the HSS and can be suppressed in the 
DF2. 
The following events are ap
plicable to the PDN-GW: 
- PMIP attach/tunnel activation; 
- PMIP detach/tunnel deactivation; 

- PMIP session modification; 

- Start of interception with active PMIP tunnel; 
- DSMIP registration/tunnel activation; 
- DSMIP deregistration/tunnel deactivation; 

- DSMIP session modification; 

- Start of interception with active DSMIP tunnel; 

- DSMIP HA Switch; 

- PMIP Resource Allocation Deactivation ; 
- Packet Data Header Information 
- Bearer activation; 

- Bearer deactivation; 

- Bearer modification; 

- Start of interceptio
n with active bearer. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1543GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
The following events are 
applicable to the ePDG: 
- Bearer activation; 
- Bearer deactivation; 

- Bearer modification: 

- Start of interceptio
n with active bearer. 
The following events are applicable to the HSS, which is national option: 
- Serving Evolved Packet System; 

 - Subscriber record change; 

 - Registration termination; 

 - Location information request. 
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events trigger the transmission of the 
information from the nodes to DF2. Available IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the 
nodes, if this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information if this is necessary as a national 

option. When the GTP protocol is used over the s2b inte
rface, elements from table 12.2.1.2 are included in the 
applicable events.

a) source and destination IP Addresses, 
b) IP next-layer protocol, 
c) Layer-4 ports, and 
d) Flow label, if the packet is IPv6 
2) summary information for the number of packets and bytes transmitted or received by the target for each unique 
packet flow within an EPS bearer, and

6-tuple of source/destination IP address/port number and the layer 4 protocol and EPS bearer. 
 IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always re
ported, the flow label is reported if the packet is IPv6, 
and the layer-4 ports are reported. 
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique p
acket data session (EPS bearer) and packet flow, and is 
triggered by one of the following: 
- start of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer 
- an interim report for a packet flow associat
ed with an EPS bearer is to be reported 
- end of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer (including end of the EPS bearer itself). 
An interim report can be triggered by 
- The expiration of a configurable timer per inter
cept (called a Summary Timer). The Summary Timer is 
configurable in units of seconds; 
- A per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached. 
These elements will be delivered either directly to
 DF2 or via DF3 for each packet flow if available:

 12.6 Functional requirements for LI in case of Handovers 
between E-UTRAN and CDMA2000 Accesses. 
When an handover is performed from CDMA2000 Access to E-UTRAN, the MME shall intercept the attach event 
received from the HRPD AN based on IMSI. 
Interception at S-GW and PDN-GW shall be done according to
 the requirements given in section 12.2 or 12.3 and 
related subsections, depending on the pr
otocol used over the S5/S8 interface. 
12.7 Functional requirements for LI in case of interworking 
between SGSN and EPS nodes over S4/S12 interfaces 
The SGSN and the HSS are subjected to the requirements app
licable to these nodes for PS
 interception, as specified 
throughout this document. 
The S-GW is subjected to the requirements specified in s
ection 12.2 and subsections. The applicable events shall be 
reported also when received from the SGSN over S4 interface. CC shall be also reported when received over S4/S12 
interfaces. The network procedures for which the events
 applicable to the S-GW, defined in section 12.2 and 
subsections, are generated when the S-GW is connected over S4/S12 interfaces to a SGSN are defined in 

TS 23.060 [10]. 
The PDN-GW is subjected to the requirements specified in section 12.2 or 12.3 and related subsections, depending on 
the protocol used on S5/S8 interfaces, which are applicable 
also to the case in which the PDN-GW is involved for a 
target for which a S4 based SGSN is used. 
12.8 Functional requirements for LI in case of interworking 
between SGSN and PDN-GW over Gn/Gp interfaces 
According to TS 23.060 [10] and TS 23.401 [22] a PDN-GW may provide a Gn/Gp interface for interworking with the 
SGSN. When this interface is provided, from LI perspec
tive the PDN-GW acts as a GGSN towards the involved SGSN. 
In this case, in addition to the requirements specified in this clause, all the requirements specified by this document for 

the GGSN are applicable to the PDN-GW. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1673GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
The PDN-GW shall use the same correlation number in r
ecords when the PDP contex
t/EPS bearer modification 
signalling is detected due to the handover between different accesses involving a Gn/Gp interface (i.e. from E-UTRAN 
to 2G/3G and vice versa). After the handover, the PDN-GW 
shall report the events applicable to the new access and 

continue to use the same correlation number 
inside the same PDP context/EPS bearer. 
The SGSN is subjected to the requirements applicable to th
is node for PS interception, as specified throughout this 
document. 
12.9 Functional Requirements for LI in case of Control and User 
Plane Separation 
12.9.1 Background 
As defined in 3GPP TS 23.214 [75], the Serving Gateway and PDN Gateway may have separated control plane and user 

plane functions. The control plane (CP) functions (Servi
ng Gateway-C and PDN Gateway-C) provide the traffic 
forwarding rules (referred to as Forward Action Rules in 3GPP TS 23.214 [75]) to the user plane (UP) functions 

(Serving Gateway-U and PDN Gateway-U).  The UP functions 
forward the user plane traffic as per the Forward Action 
Rules.   
As defined in subclause 12.1 of the present document, the Serving Gateway and PDN Gateway provide the LI functions 
for the EPC packet data interception. As defined in subc
lause 15.2, a PDN Gateway can also provide the CC Intercept 
Function for an IMS-based VoLTE. As defined in clause 20, the BBIFF functions of an S8HR LI functions may be 

implemented within a Serving Gateway. Therefore, the LI functions available in the Serving Gateway and PDN 

Gateway shall be carried over to the split Serving Gateway and PDN Gateway with the new CUPS architecture.  
12.9.2 LI Architecture with CUPS
 12.9.2.1 Overview 
With CUPS, all the signalling related interfaces (i.e., control plane data) terminate at the Serving Gateway C and PDN 
Gateway-C. Therefore, the IRI related LI functions provided within a Serving Gateway and PDN Gateway for EPC 
packet data interception shall be pr
ovided by the Serving Gateway-C and PDN Gateway-C respectively. The X2 
reference point terminates at the Serving Gateway-C and PDN Gateway-C.   
With CUPS, user plane data pass through the Serving Gateway-U and PDN Gateway-U. Therefore, the duplication of 
user plane data to support the CC interception for EPC packet data shall be done at the Serving Gateway-U and PDN 

Gateway-U. A new LI specific functional element referred to as Split X3 LI Interworking Function (SX3LIF) is 
defined.  
NOTE 1: The SX3LIF can be co-located with a UP function or a CP function or can be a standalone point.  
The UP function duplicates the user plane packets of the traf
fic to be intercepted (identified by the packet detection 
rules) as instructed by the CP function and then sends th
e duplicated user plane packets 
to the SX3LIF over the X3u 
reference point. The CP function also provides the forwardi
ng action rules to the UP function which enables the UP 
function to determine how to send the duplicated user plan
e packets over the X3u reference point to the SX3LIF. The 
CP function provides the intercept control information (such as correlation identifier, target identity, and intercepted 
packet identification rules) to the SX3LIF over the X3c 
reference point. The SX3LIF receives the user plane packets 
from the UP function (over the X3u reference point), associates
 the user plane packets to the target interception based 
on the intercept related information that it received from the CP function (over the X3c reference point) and then 

delivers the CC to the DF3 over the X3 reference point.  
The LI architecture for EPC packet data interception wi
th CUPS is depicted in the following figure 12.1.4.  
NOTE 2: The present document defines an LI architecture for CUPS where CUPS has been applied to single 
operator PLMN. 
12.9.2.2 Packet detection rules 
The packet detection rules allow the UP function to determin
e which user plane packets are duplicated and sent to the 
SX3LIF.     
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1683GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
NOTE: The packet detection rules may be different for Serving Gateway-U and PDN Gateway-U. For example, 
the packet detection Rules for a Serving Gateway-U may be based on the GTP tunnel Id of the bearer 
from which the user plane packets are to be dupli
cated and forwarded to SX3L
IF. The Packet detection 
rules for a PDN Gateway-U may be based e.g. on the UE IP address sent to, received from, which the 

user plane packets are to be dup
licated and forwarded to SX3LIF. 
12.9.2.3 Forwarding action rules 
The forwarding action rules indicate how the UP function is 
to forward the duplicated pack
ets to the SX3LIF over the 
X3u reference point. The information such as the destination IP address at the SX3LIF and the GTP tunnel Id of the 

tunnel toward which the duplicated packets are sent on th
e X3u reference point may be part of the forwarding action 
rules.   
12.9.2.4 Intercepted packet identification rules 
The intercepted packet identification rules allow the SX3LIF
 to identify and associate the user plane packets received 
over the X3u reference point to the target intercept informat
ion. Part of the forwarding action rules (e.g. the information 
such as destination IP address of X3u tunnel, GTP tunnel Id of the X3u tunnel), target identity and correlation identifier 

are part of the intercepted packet identification rules.  
The SX3LIF uses the IP address and the GTP tunnel Id of the tunnel on the X3u reference point to associate the 
received user plane packets with the target intercept info
rmation that it receives from the CP function over X3c 
reference point.  
12.9.3 Provision of Content of Communications 
12.9.3 1 Interception for Serving Gateway 
When the CC interception is required and is to be done at the Serving Gateway, the Serving Gateway-C shall 

send/activate the following information to the Serving Gateway-U:  
- Packet detection rules as described in subclause 12.9.2.2 
- Forwarding action rules as described in 12.9.2.3 

- An indication to perform the packet duplication and forward the same to the SX3LIF.

- correlation identifier 
- Intercepted packet identification rules as described in subclause 12.9.2.4. 
The Serving Gateway-U shall identify the user plane packets 
as per the packet detection rules (subsclause 12.9.2.2) and 
shall forward the packets to the SX3LIF over the X3u refe
rence point as per the forwarding action rules (subclause 
12.9.2.3). The SX3LIF shall associate the user plane packets 
to the target interception as
 per the intercepted packet 
identification rules and shall deliver the CC to DF3 over the X3 reference point as defined in the subclause12.2.2 and 
subclause 12.4.2. 
12.9.3.2 Interception for PDN Gateway 
When the CC interception is required and is to be done at the PDN Gateway, the PDN Gateway-C shall/activate send 
the following information to the PDN Gateway-U.  
- Packet detection rules as described in 12.9.2.2  
- Forwarding action rules as described in 12.9.2.3 

- An indication to perform the packet duplication and forward the same to the SX3LIF. 
In addition, the PDN Gateway-C shall send the following information to the SX3LIF: 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1693GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
- target identity 
- correlation identifier 

- Intercepted packet identification rules as described in 12.9.2.4.  
The PDN Gateway-U shall identify the user plane packets as per the packet detection rules (subsclause 12.9.2.2) and 
shall forward the packets to the SX3LIF over the X3u refe
rence point as per the forwarding action rules (subclause 
12.9.2.3). The SX3LIF shall associate the user plane packets 
to the target interception as
 per the intercepted packet 
identification rules and shall deliver the CC to DF3 over the X3 reference point as defined subclause 12.4.2 and 

subclause 12.5.2. 
12.9.4 Provision of Intercept Related Information 
12.9.4.1 Interception at the Serving Gateway 
When the IRI interception is to be done at the Serving Gateway, the Serving Gateway-C shall deliver the IRI over the 

X2 reference point to DF2 as defined in subclause 12.2.3, and subclause 12.4.3 with the following exception: 
- The Serving Gateway-C: 
- informs the SX3LIF to generate the IRI events that re
quire access to the user plane packets (e.g. packet data 
header information), and 
- provides information to the Serving Gateway-U as it
 does for CC interception in accordance with 12.9.3.1. 
- The SX3LIF delivers the IRI events that require access 
to the user plane packets (e.g. packet data header 
information).  
12.9.4.2 Interception at the PDN Gateway 
When the IRI interception is to be done at the PDN Gateway, the PDN Gateway-C shall deliver the IRI over the X2 

reference point to DF2 as defined in subclause 12.2.3, subc
lause 12.3.3, subclause 12.4.3 and subclause 12.5.3 with the 
following exception: 
- The PDN Gateway-C: 
- informs the SX3LIF to generate the IRI events that re
quire access to the user plane packets (e.g. packet data 
header information), and 
- provides information to the PDN Gateway-U as it 
does for CC interception in accordance with 12.9.3.2.  
- SX3LIF delivers the IRI events that require access to
 the user plane packets (e.g. packet data header 
information).  
13 Lawful Interception for 3GPP H(e)NBs 
13.0 General 
Home Node B (HNB) and Home enhanced Node B (HeNB)
 are jointly referred to as H(e)NB as defined in 
TS 22.220 [31]. As identified in TS 33.106 [7], lawful interception for 3GPP H(e)NBs can be based on three different 
targets: a target accessing a H(e)NB, a target CSG of a H(e)NB, and a target H(e)NB. 
LI for a target CSG is FFS. 

LI for a target H(e)NB is FFS. 

LI for Local IP Access (LIPA) via a H(e)NB is FFS. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1703GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
13.1 Provision of Intercepted C
ontent of Communications for 
3GPP H(e)NBs 
The access method for the delivery of intercepted content of 
communications (CC) is based 
on duplication of packets 
without modification. 
See clause 13.4 for UMTS HNB specifics and 13.5 for HeNB specifics. 
NOTE: In the case where the UE is the target of intercept,
 from the perspective of the core network, a H(e)NB is 
treated the same as a NodeB or eNodeB for CC interception purposes (i.e., no additional LI functionality 
is required). 
13.2 Provision of Intercept Related Information for 3GPP 
H(e)NBs 
13.2.1 X2-interface 
The following information needs to be transferred to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality: 
- target identity (IMSI, IMEI, MSISDN, ME Id); 
- events and associated parameters as defined in sections 13.4.3 may be provided; 
- the H(e)NB location (if available); 

- H(e)NB ID; 
H(e)NB location information needs to be transferred from the location verifying nodes per TS 33.320 [34]to the DF2 in 
order to allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. The manner that the location verifying node provides the DF2 with 

the H(e)NB location is outside the scope of this document. 
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism. 
13.3 3GPP H(e)NB LI Events and Event Information 
For a target UE that is attached to any H(e)NB, LI events and messages for 3GPP H(e)NBs defined in this clause shall 
be reported in addition to the LI events and messages defined in other clauses of this document. H(e)NB LI events and 

event information are included in 13.4 for UMTS HNBs and 13.5 for HeNBs. 
A set of possible elements as shown below is used to genera
te the events. Information associated with the events is 
transmitted from the IRI ICES to DF2.

Interception architecture and functions that are needed to provide the GBA base
d application specific encryption keys 
from the GBA architecture towards the DF2 for a 
subscriber that is target of interception.

are used to decrypt the intercepted communication secured 
using those GBA application specific keys. Interception of 

the content of communications for GBA secured services is not part of this section and can be achieved via other 

methods outlined in this specification. The Ua protocol Id 
and the NAF Id along with the GBA application specific keys 
will allow the LEMF to decrypt 
the received intercepted packets.

15 Invocation of Lawful In
terception for IMS-based VoIP 15.1 Overview of VoIP Interception 
The capabilities defined in this clause apply when the interception of content of communications for IMS-based VoIP is 

to be separated from the interception of content of communi
cation at the packet data network. Non-Local ID targeting 
described in clause 7.A is also valid in such case. 
The network nodes, involved in providing the interception of an IMS-based VoIP call, shall be determined based on the 
deployment configuration and the call scenario. The scenarios where the media transport nodes and signalling nodes are 
handled by different CSPs are beyond the scope of this standard. 
NOTE: Lawful interception of VoIP as it applies SR-VCC (see TS 23.237 [45]) is for further study. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1803GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
The interception of IRI for a VoIP call shall be done accord
ing to 15.3. The interception of VoIP CC shall be done 
according to 15.2. 
15.2 Provision of Content of Communications 
15.2.0 Overview 
As the interception of CC needs to be done at a network node
 that has access to the voice media, and that interception of 
CC is required for all targeted calls, including forwarded calls and transferred calls, the CSP needs to support the 
capability to dynamically trigger CC interception for a call at a network node that has access to the voice media. 

Depending on the CSP's network configuration and the call s
cenario, different network elem
ents will intercept the CC. 
The interception and delivery of CC for VoIP may be done at the following functional element: 
1) PDN-GW/GGSN; 
2) IMS-AGW; 
3) TrGW; 

4) IM-MGW; 

5) MRF. 

NOTE 2: Other functional elements may also be 
applicable in specific deployment scenarios. 

NOTE 3: The redirection of target communications to a specific network element purely for LI purposes is 
undesirable. 
The functional elements that provide the signalling to generate the trigger for the CC interception may be any of the 
following functional elements: 
- P-CSCF, for PDN-GW/GGSN and IMS-AGW; 
- IBCF for TrGW; 

- MGCF for IM-MGW; 
- S-CSCF or AS for MRF. 
At any given time, for a specific target and for any given call, only one functional element is required to provide the CC 
interception. The functional element that provides the CC interception may vary, primarily, based on the call scenario. 
Annex E shows scenarios where the use of the above functional elements is applicable. 
15.2.1 General Principles of CC Interception 
15.2.1.1 Intercept Trigger 
As the interception of IRI and CC is required for all target
ed VoIP calls, including forwarded and transferred calls, the 
CC shall be correlated with the IRI. The CC Interception Triggering Function triggers the CC interception for a call at 
the CC Intercept Function. The placement of the CC Intercep
tion Triggering Function is dependent on CSP network 
implementation, the call scenario, and the placement of network nodes that have access to the voice media. 
The CC Interception Triggering Functions sends a CC intercept trigger to the CC Interception Function to activate CC 
interception for a call. 
The intercept trigger, at the minimum, shall consist of the following: 
- Correlation Identifier; 
- Media Identifier 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1813GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
The Correlation Identifier is used correlate the CC with the corresponding IRI data and is delivered from the CC 
Intercept Function in the intercepted 
media packet (i.e., CC) over the X3 
interface to the Delivery Function 3. 
The Media Identifier is used to identify th
e media packets that have to be intercepted. The technique used in defining 
the Media Identifier is implementation specific. 
The information passed in this CC intercept trigger shall adhere to the security requirements outlined in clause 8. 

The mechanism used to provide the correlation between 
CC and IRI is implementation specific. For instance: 
- The CC Interception Triggering Function may send the correlation identifier value to the CC Interception 
Function that forwards it to DF3 onto X3 interface; 
- The CC Interception Triggering Function may send the correlation identifier (onto X2 
interface) to the DF2 that 
forwards it to DF3. In this case the SDP information ma
y be used to associate the CC packets with the IRI. 
15.2.1.2 X3-Interface 
For the delivery of intercepted media packets, the following information shall be passed from the CC Intercept Function 
to the Delivery Function 3 in addition to the intercepted media packets: 
- target identity;
 - correlation identifier
; - SDP information (optional); 
- time stamp (optional);
 - direction (indicates media is from or to the target) - 
optional;
 The Delivery Function 3 delivers the inform
ation to the LEMF over the HI3 interface based on the national regulations. 
15.2.2 VoIP CC Interception 
The capabilities defined in this clause apply for the following cases: 
- When a target originates a call or receives an incoming call - the target's media passes through the indicated CC 
Intercept Function. 
- When an incoming call to the target is forwarded, the media of the forwarded call passes through the indicated 
CC Intercept Function. 
The term "CC Intercept Function" is a ge
neric term used to denote a network function that has access to the voice media 
of an intercepted call. The term "CC Interception Triggering Function" is a generic term used to denote a network 
function that provides a trigger to intercept the CC. The examples of CC Intercept Function and CC Interception 

Triggering Function are listed at the beginning of clause 15.2 
Figure 15.1 illustrates the CC interception at the CC Intercept Function for a basic call. Figure 15.2 illustrates the CC 
interception at the CC Intercept Function for a forwarded call.

In figure 15.1, the Target is the target and the Other Party is the called party when the target originates a call; and the 
Other Party is the calling party when the target receives an incoming call. In both cases, the media passes through the 

CC Intercept Function present on the side of target's access network. 
In figure 15.2 (below), there is no Target (i.e., target) show
n because this is the scenario
 where an incoming call to a 
target gets forwarded. The figure 15.2 shows the calling party who originated call and the forwarded-to-party who

tercept trigger to the CC 
Intercept Func
tion according 
15.2.1.1. The CC Intercept Function inter
cepts media packets for the call (identified based on the Media Identifier 
information received over the inter
cept trigger) and delivers the media 
packets as according to 15.2.1.2. 
See Annex E and Annex F for details of Call Forwarding related scenarios and call flows. 
15.2.3 Media Information Associated with the CC 
When the media description known through the SDP offer and answer at the IRI ICE is different from the media 
description known to the CC Intercept Function, then CC Intercept Triggering Function may have to send the media 
description to the DF2 for reporting to the LEMF. See Annex G for illustrative examples. 
NOTE: In case the CC Intercept Triggering Function is included in the P-CSCF this may be achieved by using the
X2 interface between the P-CSCF and DF2/MF. 
The media description associated with the CC delivered to th
e LEMF over HI3 shall also be reported to the LEMF in 
case it is different from both of the above indicated media descriptions. 
15.2.4 CC Interception in HPLMN with IMS Roaming 
For roaming targets who are physically not in the legal jurisdiction of the home network, depending on the roaming 
architecture deployed, media of the target may not enter the HPLMN for certain call scenarios. In such situations, based 
on the national option, the HPLMN served with the intercept order shall do the following: 
- Perform the interception without the CC and report to the LEMF that the CC is unavailable due to target's 
roaming situation. Note that the Evolved Serving System message (when EPS is part of the IP-CAN) also 

indicates to the LEMF that the target is roaming. 
See TS 33.108 [11] for the method used to report the CC unavailability indication.

15.2.5 CC Interception with CUPS  
With control and user plane separation of PDN-GW, the LI architecture defined in subclause 12.9 shall be used to provide 
the CC Intercept Function at the PDN-GW with the following extensions: 
- The PDN Gateway-C shall receive the CC intercept 
trigger from the CC Intercept Triggering Function. 
- The PDN Gateway-C shall use the target identity and 
correlation identifier receive
d from the CC Intercept 
Triggering Function to notify the SX3LIF.  
- The PDN Gateway-C shall send the packet detection rules (as described in subclause 12.9.2) to intercept the user 
plane packets from the media bearer to the PDN Gateway-U.  
The PDN Gateway-U shall forward user plane packets to the SX3LIF as described in subclause 12.9. The SX3LIF shall 
deliver the CC to the DF3 over X3 as described in subclause 12.9 and subclause 15.2. 
15.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information for VoIP 
See clause 7.A. 
15.4 Lawful interception in the VPLMN with IMS roaming 
15.4.1 Local breakout with P-CSCF in the VPLMN 
LBO (as defined in TS 23.228 [43]) as a roaming architecture 
used for VoLTE is one of the examples of IMS roaming. 
Local Breakout architecture has several options (LBO Home Routing, LBO Visited Routing: the interception of IRI and 

CC in the VPLMN are independent of such options). 
When an inbound roaming target originates a call or receives a terminating call, the P-CSCF present in the VPLMN 
provides IRI interception functions as described in clause 7A. The PDN-GW/GGSN or the IMS-AGW deployed in the 

VPLMN provides the CC interception as described in clause 15.2. The P-CSCF sends the CC intercept trigger to the 

PDN-GW/GGSN or to the IMS-AGW as described in clause 15.2. 
NOTE: The extent of the LI capabilities available in the VPLMN is limited to the information available in the 
VPLMN. In addition, almost all the supplement services are handled in the HPLMN. Hence, where 

supplementary services are exclusively handled in the HPLMN and information related to that service is 

not available in the VPLMN, LI for that service might be limited or even not available in the VPLMN. 

For example, when an incoming call to the inbound roaming target is forwarded (by the HPLMN), the 

VPLMN is not involved in that call forwarding and therefore, no reporting will be done by the VPLMN. 
For call forwarding no answer, the initial reporting might be done, however, once the forwarding 
happens, the VPLMN reports that the call has ended. 
Annex E illustrates a few scenarios of lawful interception in the VPLMN for inbound roaming target. 
16 LI for Group Communications using GCSE 
16.1 Background 
There are several scenarios possible for 
the interception of group communications involving GCSE (see TS 22.468 [51] 
and TS 23.468 [53]). First is where the GCSE AS is part of an operator's network. Second is where the GCSE AS is 

outside of the intercepting operator's network. This clause specifies LI solutions for both cases. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)1853GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
16.2 GCSE AS in Operator Network 
16.2.0 General 
In the case where the GCSE AS is in the operator's network, the ICE in this case will be the GCSE AS as it is fully 
aware of the group communications as well as the parties on the communications. The solution is very similar to the 

conferencing solution specified in Clause 11, where the main 
difference is that a single functional entity (the GCSE AS) 
is utilized for GCSE, rather than two functional entities.

Figure 17.1-1 shows the CC interception configuration for 
ProSe Direct Discovery. The HI2 interface represents the 
interface between the LEA and the delivery function. The delivery function is used to distribute the Intercept Related 
Information (IRI) to the relevant LEA(s) via HI2. See Clause 4 for more information on the ADMF and other interfaces. 
The target identity for ProSe Direct Discovery interception is the IMSI. The activation, deactivation, and interrogation 
of interception regarding the ProSe Function shall follow the requirements of Clause 5. 
17.1.2 Provision of Inteception of Call Content 
Interception of direct discovery does not have a call conten
t component as all the information useful to the LEA is 
provided as part of the IRI interception. 
17.1.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information 
17.1.3.1 General 
Figure 17.1.3.1-1 shows the transfer of intercept related information (IRI) to the DF2. If an event involving a target 

occurs, the ProSe Function shall send the relevant data to 
the DF2. A UE always contacts the ProSe Function in its 
HPLM, which then contacts the other relevant ProSe Functions to complete the UEs request.In the case of Match 

Report event, it is possible that a non-target monitoring UE will tigger interception of a target UE when it reports a code 

announced by that target UE. 
This is illustrated in the following figure where it should be noted that only one subcriber to HPLMN ProSe Function 
interaction is needed to trigger an interception event.

 17.2 ProSe One To Many Communications 
17.2.1 General 
Proximity Service (ProSe) are specified in TS 23.303 [52]. This includes one to many communications among Public 
Safety ProSe UEs with such communication occuring while the 
UEs are in proximity. There are several procedures that 
takes place with network elements as part of a typical one-
to-many commuication. The UE 
needs to be authorised by 
the ProSe Function, and receive keys from the ProSe Key Management Function (PKMF - see TS 33.303 [57], 
TS 23.228 [43]). After such a communication, the UE reports the relevant usage information to the ProSe Function. 

This subclause details the interception at the ProSe Function and ProSe Key Management Function. 
NOTE: The present document does not provide a solution 
for the interception of content of communication. 
Editor's note: Interception of ProSe one-to-many communication with the group as the target is FFS.

Figure 17.2.2.1-1 shows the transfer of IRI relating to the one to many communications from the ProSe Function and 

ProSe Key Management Function to the DF2 and to the LEMF
. If a target UE interacts with the ProSe Function or 
ProSe Key Management Function relating to one-to-many communications, a One-To-Many IRI event, is generated and 

sent via the Delivery Function 2 to the LEMF. 
If an event involving an target occurs, the ProSe Function or ProSe Key Management Function shall send the relevant 
data to the DF2 for formatting and delivery to the LEMF.

17.3 ProSe Remote UE Communications 
17.3.1 General 
A ProSe Remote UE can initiate communications via a ProSe UE-to-NW Relay and the core network as described in 
TS 23.303 [52]. 
From LI perspective, the followi
ng scenarios can be identified: 
1. The ProSe Remote UE is a target for interception 

2. The ProSe UE-to-NW Relay is a target for interception 

3. Both the ProSe Remote UE and the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay are target for interception. 

NOTE: The ProSe Remote UE and the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay 
are considered target for in
terception if any of the 
identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI) related to the UE or the user is target for interception. 
In the following subclauses, scenarios 1 and 2 are addressed, scenario 3 is covered by using both scenario 1 and 2. 

Interception in the PDN-GW is a national option. 
17.3.2 The ProSe Remote UE is a target for interception 
When a ProSe Remote UE connects to the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay, the core network (MME, S-GW, PDN-GW) 
receives the related information from the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay. If the ProSe Remote UE is a target, a ProSe Remote 

UE start of communication event shall be generated by the S-GW, PDN-GW. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2013GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
If the warrant requires to intercept also CC, considering 
that the PDN connection used by the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay 
can be used also for other, non-target, ProSe Remote UE
s, the S-GW/PDN-GW shall isolate the target ProSe remote 
UE's communication from any content of communication not associated to the remote UE under interception. CC 
related to the target ProSe Remote UE shall be sent over X3 interface. 
When a target ProSe Remote UE disconnects from the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay, a ProSe Remote UE end of 
communication event shall be generated by the S-GW, PDN-GW. CC interception for the target ProSe Remote UE shall 
be stopped. 
In both cases of connection and disconnection of a target 
ProSe Remote UE, the MME shall generate a ProSe Remote 
UE Report event. 

In case the whole PDN connection used by the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay is closed for any reason while a target Remote 
UE is connected to the ProSe UE-to-NW relay, a ProSe Re
mote UE end of communication event shall be generated by 
the S-GW/PDN-GW and sent to the DF2. 
If interception is started after that the ProSe remote UE is
 already connected to the network through a ProSe UE-to-NW 
Relay, a Start of interception with ProSe Remote UE ongoing communication event shall be provided by the S-
GW/PDN-GW. The same event shall also be sent by the new S-GW in case, due to ProSe UE-to-NW Relay mobility, 

there is a change of S-GW. The ICEs shall than start inte
rcepting the target UEs communication by extracting it from 
the PDN connection used by the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay UE. 
17.3.3 The ProSe UE-to-NW Relay 
is a target for interception 
The ProSe UE-to-NW Relay uses one or more PDN connections for any activity/communication which is not related to 
relaying. In such case all the requirements specified for EPS interception in clause 12 apply. In addition, IRIs related 
specified in clause 12 are also applicable
 to the PDN connection used for relay. 
This clause specifies additional functional requirements which are applicable to the PDN connection(s) established by 
the ProSe UE-to-NW Relay. 
PDN connection(s) used for relaying only carry communications
 for the ProSe remote UEs. So, unless any of them is 
also a target for interception (for which clause 17.3.2 appl
y), no content of communication shall be intercepted from 
such PDN connection(s), unless required by national regulation, in which case all requirements specified in clause 12 
apply also to these PDN connection(s). 
In case ProSe remote UEs are connected to or disconnected
 from the target ProSe UE-to-NW Relay, the ICEs (MME, 
S-GW, PDN-GW) shall provide a ProSe Remote UE Report event, including the identities and IP info of ProSe remote 
UE(s) being connected/ disconnected. 
In case interception is activated for a ProSe UE-to-NW Relay with already connected ProSe remote UE(s), the ICEs 
shall provide a Start of interception for ProSeUE-to-NW Relay, including the identities and IP info of ProSe remote 
UEs already connected to the relay. The same event shall al
so be sent by the new S-GW in case, due to ProSe UE-to-
NW Relay mobility, there is a change of S-GW. 
In case a Tracking Area/EPS Location Update event is provided for a target ProSe UE-to-NW Relay, it shall carry also 
information related to the connected ProSe remote UE(s). 
17.3.4 X2-interface 
The following information needs to be transferred from the EPS nodes (MME, S-GW, PDN-GW) to the DF2 in order to 
allow a DF2 to perform its functionality: 
- target identity (IMSI, MSISDN, IMEI); 
- events and associated parameters as defined in clause 17.3.4.1. 
17.3.4.1 Structure of the events 
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2 if this is required. Details are described in 
the following clauses. The events for interception are conf
igurable (if they are sent to DF2) in the EPC nodes. 
The following event is applicable to the MME: 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2023GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
- ProSe Remote UE Report; 
The following events are applicable to the S-GW and PDN-GW: 
- ProSe Remote UE start of communication; 
- ProSe Remote UE end of communication; 

- Start of interception with ProSe Remote UE ongoing communication; 

- Start of interception for ProSe UE-to-NW Relay.

18 Invocation of Lawful
 Interception for messaging services 
18.1 Overview of messagi
ng services interception 
The capabilities defined in this clause apply when the interception of messaging services shall be separated from the 

interception of all other services. This clause applies to the messaging services identified in clause 5.13 of 
TS 33.106 [7]. 
For messaging services, separated delivery when SMS events are detected, the CSP shall be able to use existing 
intercept capabilities defined in this specification, but isolatable to only deliver messaging services when specified by a 

lawful authorisation. 
The network nodes, involved in providing the interception of messaging services, shall be determined based on the 
deployment configuration and the messaging scenario. 
When lawfully authorized, Law Enforcement requires access to CC and IRI for the events pertaining to the target's 
authorization, access to, and use of message services, independent of the deployed service architecture. This includes 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2053GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
where the communications between the target and associates are sent and received over separate channels, or may be 
accessed at different ICEs at different geographical
 locations in the service provider's network. 
For MMS, implementation options considered in this standard are: interception at the MMS level or normal packet 

session CC interception at an PS/IMS/EPS ICE and transferred to the DF2/DF3 which then subsequently isolates and 

delivers the MMS IRI and/or CC associated with the messaging service separate from all other services. Details of IRI 

and CC reporting for MMS events are for further study. 
18.2 SMS 
18.2.1 Introduction 
LI for SMS over a GPRS and UMTS access is specified in clause 7. LI for SMS over IP (using IMS SIP signalling 

handled by the core network) which can be used in conjunction with LTE access as well as other non-3GPP IP based 
access is defined in clause 7A.6. 
18.2.2 SMS over GPRS/UMTS 
For separate delivery of SMS when SMS is used in conjunc
tion with GPRS or UMTS access, the following events shall 
be reported by the ICE to the DF: 
1) SMS (clause 7.4.7) 
2) HLR Related events 
a. Serving System (clause 7.4.9) 

b. HLR subscriber record change (clause 7.4.12) 
c. Cancel location (clause 7.4.13); 
d. Register location (clause 7.4.14); 

e. Location information request (clause 7.4.15). 
The above events shall be reported from the ICE to the DF independent of any other services that may or may not be 
intercepted. 
18.2.3 SMS over IP 
For separate delivery of SMS when SMS over IP (using IMS SIP signalling handled by the core network) is used, the 

following events shall be reported by the ICE to the DF: 
1) Intercepted SIP event as described in clause 7A.3.0 
2) HSS related events 
a. Serving System (clause 7A.2.3.1) for use when roaming 

b. IMPU or IMPI changed in a HSS subscr
iber record change (clause 7A.2.3.2); 
c. Registration termination (clause 7A.2.3.3); 
d. Location information request (clause 7A.2.3.4). 
The above events shall be able to be reported from the ICE to the DF independent of and to the exclusion of any other 
services that may or may not be intercepted. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2063GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
18.3 MMS 
18.3.1 Background 
Clause 7.6 defines an interception solution for MMS over GPRS/UMTS whereby the packet IP stream is sent to the DF 
and onto to the LEMF for LE to extract the MMS information. However, that solution does not allow for the separate 

delivery of MMS from other services. In fact, that approach necessitates the interception and delivery of a packet data 
session which may not be authorized for interception. This clause defines an approach to intercept and deliver only 
MMS related events and deliver those separate from any other services that may or may not be intercepted. 
It is a national option for the CSP and LEA to agree on the maximum size of and MMS to be delivered to the LEMF. If 
the MMS is bigger than the agreed size it is a national option for what to do (e.g. don't deliver it to the LEMF). 
MMS service is defined in TS 22.140 [74], OMA's MMS Architecture OMA-AD-MMS-V1_3-20110913-A [72], and 
OMA's Multimedia Messaging Service Encapsulation Protocol OMA-TS-MMS_ENC-V1_3-20110913-A [73]. 
The key network elements involved in the support of MMS is the MMS Proxy-Relay. The MMS Proxy-Relay is 
responsible for: 
1) receiving a MMS from a served UE and forwarding that to the MMS Proxy-Relay of the destination UE, 
2) receiving a MMS from an originating MMS Proxy-Relay 
and forwarding this MMS or a notification of it to its 
served UE, 
3) receiving a request for retrieval of an MMS from a 
served UE and delivering that MMS to the served UE, 
4) providing the served UE with delivery status and read reports of served UE originated MMS 

5) providing a MMS/Relay of another UE with delivery status and read reports of MMS received for the served UE. 
When a Non-Local Id is used as target identity, the inte
rception shall be performed at the MMS Proxy Relay. For MMS 
messages originated from a target wth Non-Local ID, the ta
rget is identified from FROM field. For MMS messages to 
the target with Non-Local ID, the target are identified fr
om TO, CC and BCC fields. The interception may be triggered 
on the value address defined in the clause 8 of MMS addressing model of OMA's Multimedia Messaging Service 
Encapsulation Protocol OMA-TS-MMS_ENC-V1_3-20110913-A  [73].  
LI for MMS requires IRI and CC related to the MMS to be detected by the MMS Proxy-Relay and forwarded to the DF.

18.3.2 MMS Architec
ture IRI/CC Events 
The MMS architecture is provided in Clause 5 of MMS Archit
ecture [72]. The two interfaces considered in developing 
the events and event information to be reported are the MMS
M interface (between the MMS client and the MMS Proxy-
Relay) and the MMS
R interface (i.e., between two MMS Proxy-Relay nodes). 
For separate delivery of MMS, the following events shall be reported by the ICE to the DF: 
1) MMS Send 
2) MMS Notification & Confirmation 

3) MMS Retrieval Confirmation & Acknowledgement 
4) MMS Forwarding 
5) MMS Store Requests 

6) MMS Viewing Requests & Responses 

7) MMS Deletion Requests (delete from MMBox and Proxy-Relay) 

8) MMS Cancel Requests 
9) MMS Delivery Reports 
10) MMS Read Report 

11) Serving System (clause 7.4.9) 

12) Serving Evolved Packet System (clause 12.2.3.8) 
The above events shall be reported from the ICE to the DF independent of any other services that may or may not be 
intercepted. 
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events trigger the transmission of the 
information from the nodes to DF2. Available IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the 

nodes, if this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information if this is necessary as a national 

option. Where MMS CC is available during an event, in addition to the IRI event reported to DF2, an MMS CC event is 

reported to DF3.

 19 Lawful Access Location Services (LALS) 
19.1 General 
LALS provides lawful access to the target's location using the Location Services (LCS) capabilities defined in the 

TS 23.271 [68] and OMA MLP TS [76]. The present clause details the stage 2 Lawful Interception architecture and 

functions that are needed to provide the 
LCS information to the DF2 for a target of interception for subsequent delivery 
to the LEMF. Commercial LCS shall meet Clause 8 security re
quirements and provide priority to Lawful interception 
requests. 
NOTE 1: For inbound roamers, if the VPLMN LCS Server/GMLC queries HSS/HLR in the HPLMN, this may 
cause detectability issues. Similarly for outbound roam
ers, sending location requests to the VPLMN may 
cause detectability issues. 
For LALS the subscriber location privacy settings shall be overridden. 
Depending on national requirements and LCS capabilities of the network operator, the location information provided by 
LALS may vary in location information types (mobile network location format, location shape and geo-coordinates, 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 1
07 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2233GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
civic address, or a combination of those), in the set of a
dditional location parameters (map data, motion state, speed, 
etc.), as well as in the accuracy 
of provided location information. 
NOTE 2: The accuracy of positioning for any particular technology is a trade-off for the location acquisition delay. 
It also depends on other technology specific factors. 
The parameters controlling the LALS output are either delivered per authorization over HI1/X1 interface or pre-
configured in the LI-LCS client. 
There are two types of the location interception defined in the present specification: the Target Positioning and the 
Enhanced Location for IRI. 
The Target Positioning is used to determine the target's location independently of the services used by the target. 

The Enhanced Location for IRI is used to determine the LC
S-based location of the target when specific user service 
events related to the target occur. 
The authorizations for Target Positioning and for Enhanced
 Location for the same target may be independent of each 
other and may be overlapping in time or combined in a single intercept authorization by LEA. 
There may be multiple active LALS authorizations from different LEAs at any given time. 
19.2 Target Positioning 
19.2.1 General 
There are two Target Positioning provision variants supporte
d in the current specification - the Immediate Location and 
the Periodic Location. 
Figure 19.2.1 shows the architecture for the LALS where the LI
 LCS Client provides the target's location and associated 
information towards the DF2 over the X2 interface fulfilling the Target Positioning ADMF authorization delivered over 
X1_1 interface. 
 Figure 19.2.1: LALS Model for Target Positioning 
19.2.1 Immediate Location Provision 
The authorization for Immediate Location 
provision is delivered to LI LCS Client over X1_1 interface. Upon receiving 
the authorization the LI LCS Client initiates a Location Im
mediate Request (LIR, see TS 23.271 [68]) with the LCS 
Server/GMLC over Le interface and reports 
the acquired location to the DF2 over X2. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2243GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
During the period of active authorization for Immediate Loca
tion the LI LCS client may receive and process additional 
Immediate Location requests from AMDF over the X1_1. 
NOTE: The LCS Server/GMLC may be optimized to provide the same single location estimation in response to 
multiple positioning requests arriving in temporal proximity of each other. 
The resulting Immediate Location intercept product is delivered over X2 to the DF2 and propagated to the LEMF over 
HI2. 
19.2.2 Periodic Location Provision 
The authorization for Periodic Location provision is delivered to LI LCS Client over X1_1 interface. 
During the Periodic Location authorization the LI LCS Client shall produce the LALS Reports with the specified 
periodicity. 
The periodicity shall be controlled by the LI LCS Client. The LI LCS Client shall issue a series of Location Immediate 
Requests (LIR, see TS 23.271 [68]) at required time intervals. 
The LI LCS Client provides the acquire
d location reports to the DF2 over X2. 
The Request for Periodic Location from ADMF to LI LCS Client may be accompanied by a set of parameters defining 
the time interval for reporting, report periodicity, etc. The description of the service response parameters is provided in 

clause 19.4. The Periodic Location intercept product is delivered over X2 to the DF2 and propagated to LEMF over 

HI2. 
19.3 Enhanced Location for IRI 
19.3.1 General 
The Enhanced Location for IRI refers to a capability providing LCS-based location information when specific user 

service events related to the target of interception occur. 
An example of such service events are the events of IMS 
session initiation and termination. 
Figure 19.3.1-1 depicts the architecture of Enhanced Location acquisition and delivery for the case when the LTF is 
associated with an IRI ICE. 
 Figure 19.3.1-1: LALS Model for Enhanced Location for IRI (ICE/LTF option)

19.3.2 LALS Triggering Function 
The LALS Enhanced Location architecture in Figures 19.3.1-1 and 19.3.1-2 depicts the LALS Triggering Function 

(LTF). LTF is associated with an IRI ICE or with a DF2/MF 
and is responsible for triggering the LI LCS Client when a 
specific event related to the target is observe
d at the IRI ICE, or received at the DF2. 
The request for Enhanced Location reporting for IRI is delivered from ADMF to either an ICE over X1_1 or to a DF2 

over X1_2 interface along with other parameters of IRI inter
cept authorization/activation. 
The ICE(s) or the DF2 then 
arm the LTF(s). 
The ICE nodes that may have an associated LTF include P/S-CSCF, IMS AS, HLR, HSS, MSC Server, MME, 
S/GGSN, P/S-GW. 
The LTF triggers the LI LCS Client over the LALS_T interface. 

The LALS intercept product is delivered to DF2 from the 
LI LCS client over X2 interface asynchronously with the 
associated IRI event reports generated by an IRI ICE. To enable correlation between the LALS Reports and the 
associated IRI Events the LTF shall include the Correlation Identifier from the IRI Event, if available, into the LALS_T 
trigger. 
NOTE 1: The IRI events may contain the location information obtained by other means, e.g. NPLI. The LALS 
reports are augmenting that information with extra details and accuracy. 
The LALS_T interface for the LALS intercept trigger shall adhe
re to the security requirements outlined in Clause 8. 
NOTE 2: Detailed definition of the LALS_T interface is out of scope of the current specification. 
19.4 X2-interface for Target
 Positioning and Enhanced Location 
19.4.1 General 
The following information needs to be transferred from the LI LCS Client to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to 
perform its functionality:

 20 Lawful interception in the VPLMN with S8HR 
Roaming Architecture 
20.1 Architecture 
20.1.1 Overview 
When S8HR approach is used as the roaming architecture 
for VoLTE, all of the IMS nodes reside in the HPLMN. 
National regulations may require the VPLMN to have the capabilities to perform the lawful interception of voice 
services involving the inbound roaming targets. The LI capabilities provided in the VPLMN with S8HR approach as the 
roaming architecture shall be to the same extent as the LI capabilities provided in the VPLMN with LBO approach as 

the roaming architecture. 
The IMS signalling messages are exchanged between the UE and the P-CSCF (in HPLMN with S8HR) and the media is 
exchanged between the UE and the PDN-GW (in HPLMN with S8HR). Within the VPLMN with S8HR, the IMS 

signalling messages are carried over the GTP tunnel that
 corresponds to the IMS Signalling Bearer and the media 
packets are carried over the GTP tunnel that corresponds to the Media Bearer. (i.e. a dedicated EPS Bearer used to carry 

the media packets). The present document assumes that the EPS Bearer ID of the IMS Signalling Bearer is always 

linked to the dedicated EPS Bear
er used as a Media Bearer. 
New LI-specific functions are introduced to examine the packets that flow through the VPLMN packet core network 

nodes (i.e. S-GW) to generate IRI and CC when the communication involves an inbound roaming target. The LI 

architecture diagram shown in figure 1j is redrawn below with focus on the new LI specific functions and the reference 
points. 
NOTE: The overall architecture and functions related to the lawful interception of voice services of inbound 
roaming targets with S8HR as the roaming architectur
e is also referred in the present document as S8HR 
LI. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2
.0 (2017
-07)2283GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
 Figure 20.1 S8HR LI Architecture 
All the functions and reference points shown in figure 20.1 shall adhere to the security requirements specified in clause 
8. A condition required for the operation of S8HR LI is that the IMS signalling messages and the media packets are not 
encrypted at S-GW/BBIFF. Furthermore, the S8HR LI solution 
requires that APNs can be identified as being used for 
S8HR and therefore those APNs can be used to identify
 the EPS Bearers used for inbound roamers with S8HR. 
Refer to Annex J for the detailed illustration of this architecture in reference to S8HR, the process flow steps and the 

call flows. 
20.1.2 LI specific Reference Points 
Xia: Reference point between S-GW/BBIFF and LMISF. This reference point is used to carry the user plane 
information from the S-GW/BBIFF to the LMISF. 
Xib: Reference point between LMISF and the S-GW/BBIFF. This
 reference point is used to exchange the control 
plane information between the LMISF and the S-GW/BBIFF. 
20.1.3 LI Specific Functions 
20.1.3.1 Void 
 20.1.3.2 BBIFF: Bearer Binding Intercept and Forward Function 
BBIFF is a LI specific function introduced to support the lawful interception of voice services in the VPLMN when 

S8HR is used as the roaming architecture. 
BBIFF shall provide the following functions: 
- Receive a list of S8HR APNs and the packet forwarding rules that apply to all users from the LMISF over the 
Xib reference point. 
- As per the LMISF instruction, , notify the LMISF over Xib reference point whenever the IMS Signalling Bearer 
with S8HR APN is created, modified or deleted. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2293GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
- As per the packet forwarding rules (i.e. as instructed 
by the LMISF), deliver the packets of all GTP tunnels used 
for IMS Signalling Bearer with S8HR APN to the LMISF over the Xia reference point. 
- Receive the intercepted IMS Signalling Bearer informat
ion from the LMISF over the Xib reference point along 
with the packet forwarding rules. 
- Identify the dedicated EPS Bearer used as the Media B
earer linked to the  abov
e-indicated intercepted IMS 
Signalling Bearer. 
- As per the packet forwarding rules (i.e. as instructed by the LMISF), deliver the packets of the GTP tunnel used 
for Media Bearer associated with the intercepted IMS 
Signalling Bearer to the LMISF over the Xia reference 
point. 
- When instructed by the LMISF, stop delivering the packets of the GTP tunnels used for Media Bearers 
associated with the IMS Signalling Bearer with a deactivated interception. 
NOTE: The present document assumes that BBIFF is closely coupled to S-GW in the VPLMN. Therefore, 
present document refers to BBIFF as S-GW/BBIFF. 
20.1.3.3 LMISF: LI Mirror IMS State Function 
LMISF is a LI specific function introduced to support the lawful interception of voice services in the VPLMN when 
S8HR is used as the roaming architecture. 
The LMISF shall provide the following functions: 
- Provide S8HR APN information to the S-GW/BBIFF over the Xib reference point. 
- Instruct S-GW/BBIFF over Xib reference point to notify (to LMISF) whenever an IMS Signalling Bearer with 
S8HR APN is created, modified or deleted. 
- Instruct S-GW/BBIFF over the Xib reference point to start delivering the packets (to LMISF) of all IMS 
Signalling Bearers with S8HR APN. 
- Receive target identity information from the ADMF over
 the X1_1 reference point as described in clause 5.1. 
- Receive the notification from S-GW/BBIFF over the Xib reference point whenever an IMS Signalling Bearer 
with S8HR APN is created, modified or deleted. 
- Store the IMS Signalling Bearer information (e.g. EPS Bear
er ID) along with the IMSI associated with the UE to 
which the IMS Signalling Bearer was created, modified or deleted. 
- Receive and examine the IMS signalling messages delivered by the S-GW/BBIFF over the Xia reference point. 

- Receive media packets delivered by the S-GW/BBIFF over
 the Xia reference point. Identify the intercepted IMS 
session that relates to the media packets. 
- Maintain an IMS signalling state for all inbound roamers with S8HR that are registered to the network or in an 
IMS session. Part of this function is to track all IMS registrations, re-registrations and de-registrations of 
inbound roamers with S8HR. 
- After examining and determining that the IMS signalling messages involves a target, establish and maintain a 
map between the target identity and the IMS Signalling B
earer information (e.g. EPS Bearer ID along with the 
IMSI value of the UE). When the IMS signalling messages do not involve a target, establish and maintain a map 

between the IMS Signalling Bearer information and the potential target identities. 
- Inform the S-GW/BBIFF over the Xib reference point with the IMS Signalling Bearer information associated 
with an intercepted IMS session that requires CC interception and instruct the S-GW/BBIFF to start delivering 

the packets of the Media Bearer associat
ed with that IMS Signalling Bearer.  
- Inform the S-GW/BBIFF over the Xib reference point with the IMS Signalling Bearer information associated 
with a deactivated interception and in
struct the S-GW/BBIFF to stop delivering the packets of the Media Bearer 
associated with that IMS Signalling Bearer. Generate and deliver the IRI messages to the Delivery Function 2 as 

described in clause 20.3. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2303GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
- Generate and deliver the CC to the Delivery Function 3 as described in clause 20.2. 
- When target identity is received from the ADMF, determine whether any IMS Signaling Beare is associated 
target identity. If yes, start the interception process as described in clause 20.3. 
- Provide the decompression of IMS signalling messages upon detecting the compression. 
20.2 Provision of Content of Communications 
20.2.1 Overview 
20.2.1.1 General 
For interception of content of communications of voice services involving the inbound roamers with S8HR, the 
following shall occur: 
- For each IMS session that is intercepted, LMISF 
determines whether a CC interception is required. 
- When the CC is interception required, LMISF provid
es the IMS Signalling Bearer information to the S-
GW/BBIFFF (as described in clause 20.1.3.3) and instruct
s the S-GW/BBIFF (as described in clause 20.1.3.3) to 
start delivering the media packets (i.e. packets from th
e Media Bearer) associated with that IMS Signalling 
Bearer. 
- S-GW/BBIFF delivers the media packets (i.e. packets 
from the Media Bearer) associated with the IMS 
Signalling Bearer (as described in clause 20.1.3.2) to the LMISF. 
The S-GW/BBIFF shall provide the LMISF a means to link th
e intercepted media packets with the associated IMS 
Signalling Bearer information provided by the LMISF (e.g. 
the delivered media packets include the EPS Bearer ID of 
the IMS Sgnalling Bearer along with the IMSI value of the UE). 

The LMISF shall include the Correlation Information (associated with the IMS session) in the CC delivered to the 
Delivery Function 3 over the X3 reference point. A pictorial view of the CC interception is illustrated in figure 20.2 

below:

The figure 20.2 shows that LMISF provides the  IMS Si
gnalling Bearer Information to the S-GW/BBIFF. The S-
GW/BBIFF uses the IMS Signalling Bearer information to find the associated Media Bearer. 
When the LMISF identifies that the CC interception is to be stopped, the following shall occur: 
- LMISF stops delivering the CC to Delivery Function 3 over the X3 reference point. 
- LMISF provides the IMS Signalling Bearer information to the S-GW/BBIFF with an instruction  (as described in 
clause 20.1.3.3) to stop the delivery of media packets (i
.e. packets from the Media Bearer) associated with the 
IMS Signalling Bearer. 
- S-GW/BBIFF stops the delivery of the media packets associated with the IMS Signalling Bearer (as described in 
clause 20.1.3.2) to the LMISF. 
20.2.1.2 S-GW/BBIFF Procedures for CC Interception 
When instructed by the LMISF, the S-GW/BBIFF shall use th
e IMS Signalling Bearer information that it received from 
the LMISF to determine the media packets of which  EPS B
earer (i.e. the Media Bearer) has to be delivered to the 
LMISF (e.g. EPS Bearer ID of IMS Signalling Bearer is link
ed to the EPS Bearer used as the Media Bearer). Then, the 
S-GW/BBIFF shall deliver all the octets above the GTP layer of the GTP tunnel used for the Media Bearer to the 
LMISF. 
S-GW/BBIFF shall indicate to the LMISF whether the media packets were travelling to or from the HPLMN (e.g. based 
on tunnel end point IDs). 
When instructed by the LMISF, the S-GW/BBIFF shall stop the delivery of media packets to the LMISF.

20.2.1.3 Void 
20.2.1.4 LMISF Procedures for CC Interception 
Upon determining that the CC interception is required or is to be stopped for an IMS session, LMISF shall pass the IMS 
Signalling Bearer information  to the S-GW/BBIFF with an 
instruction  that indicates to the S-GW/BBIFF wherher the 
packets from the Media Bearer associated with the IMS Sign
alling Bearer shall be delivered, or not delivered, to the 
LMISF. 
When the media packets are received from the S-GW/BBIFF, 
the LMISF shall determine whether the interception is 
active on the IMS session. If active, the LMISF shall determine the Correlation Identifier (or Correlation Number) 
associated with the IMS session to which the media corresponds. If the interception is not active, the LMISF shall 
discard the media packets. 
The LMISF shall construct the CC and deliver the same to the Delivery Function 3 over X3 reference point (see clause 
20.2.2). 
20.2.2 X3-Interface 
For the delivery of intercepted media packets, the following information shall be passed from the LMISF to the 

Delivery Function 3 in addition to the intercepted media packets: 
- target identity;
 - Correlation identifier;
 - Time stamp (optional);
 - Direction (indicates media is fro
m or to the target) - optional. 
The Delivery Function 3 delivers the inform
ation to the LEMF over the HI3 interface based on the national regulations. 
20.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information 
20.3.1 Overview 
20.3.1.1 General 
For interception of intercept related information of voice services involving the inbound roaming targets with S8HR, the 

following shall occur: 
- LMISF provides the S8HR APNs to the S-GW/BBIFF 
with an indication that all packets from the IMS 
Signalling Bearer with the S8HR APN are to be delivered to the LMISF. 
- S-GW/BBIFF delivers the IMS signalling packets from
 the S8HR IMS Signalling Bearers to the LMISF. 
- LMISF examines whether the IMS signalling messages involve a target and if so, it generates and delivers the 
IRI to the Delivery Function 2. 
The LMISF shall generate the IRI from the IMS signalling messages and deliver the same to the Delivery Function 2 

over X2 reference point. All SIP messages executed on behalf of a target shall be delivered as IRI. 
The S-GW/BBIFF also notifies the LMISF whenever an S8HR
 IMS Signalling Bearer is created, modified, or deleted 
along with the IMSI value of the target UE. 
A pictorial view of the general overview of IRI interception is illustrated in figure 20.3 below: 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2333GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
 Figure 20.3: IRI Interception of voice calls involving the inbound roamer with S8HR 
The figure 20.3 shows that LMISF provides the S8HR APNs to the S-GW/BBIFF. When the IMS signalling messages 
correspond to a target, the LMISF generates the IRI and deliver the same to the Delivery Function 2 which in turn 
delivers the IRI to the LEMF. 
To support the mid-call interception, the LMISF maintains the 
IMS call state (including any necessary information from 
the SIP messages). When the target identity provisioned into the LMISF is involved in an ongoing IMS call, the LMISF 
shall start the interception as described in clause 20.3.2. 
20.3.1.2 Void 
20.3.1.3 S-GW/BBIFF Procedures for IRI interception 
When instructed by the LMISF, the S-GW/BBIFF shall notify the LMISF whenever the IMS Signalling Bearer with 
S8HR APN is created, modified or deleted. 
When instructed by the LMISF, the S-GW/BBIFF shall deliver all the octets above the GTP layer of GTP tunnel used 
for IMS Signalling Bearer to the LMISF along with th
e associated with IMS Signalling Bearer information. 
20.3.1.4 LMISF Procedures for IRI interception 
The LMISF shall receive the notification from S-GW/BBIFF 
whenever a GTP tunne
l for IMS Signalling Bearer with 
S8HR APN is created, modified or deleted. The LMISF shall store the Tunnel information (Tunnel ID) of the GTP 

tunnel along with the IMSI associated with the UE to which the GTP tunnel was created. 
The LMISF shall receive and examine the IMS signalling messages delivered by the S-GW/BBIFF. After examining 
and determining that an IMS signalling message involves a target, LMISF shall deliver the SIP message to the Delivery 

Function 2 over the X2 reference point (see clause 20.3.2). LMISF shall maintain an IMS call state for all inbound 

roaming users (for the target identity or potential target iden
tity). The maintained current IMS call state (along with the 
stored necessary information from the SIP messages) shall be sufficient to support the mid-call interception. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2343GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
When the received IMS signalling message involves compre
ssion, the LMISF shall perform the decompression of SIP 
messages (as defined in clause 8 of TS 24.229 [49]) and follow the steps used to process the uncompressed SIP 
messages. 
Refer to clause 20.1.3.3 for a complete list of LMISF functions that also include a few functions that aid the overall 
interception capabilities of voice services involving the inbound roamers with S8HR as the roaming architecture. 
20.3.2 IRI Events 
20.3.2.1 General 
In general, the IRI events applicable to S8HR LI are sim
ilar to the IRI events defined in clause 7A except that the 
LMISF (instead of CSCF) examines and generates the IRI ev
ents. However, since the interception in LMISF is used 
only for S8HR LI (i.e. roaming case), certain ev
ents defined in clause 7A are not applicable: 
Any SIP messages sent to, and received from, the target UE as observed at the S-GW/BBIFF shall be delivered as IRI 

with the additional information as listed in clause 20.3.3. 
NOTE: The provision of location information is FFS. 
The provisioned target identity can be a SIP URL, a TEL URL 
or an IMEI. The method used to verify a target identity 
is dependent on the call direction. S-GW/BBIFF shall indicate to the LMISF whether the IMS signalling packets were 

travelling to or from the HPLMN (e.g. based tunnel end point IDs). 
For calls originating from the inbound roaming target, calling party identity (e.g. SIP headers: P-Preferred-Id, From) is 
used verify the target identity. For calls terminating to the inbound roaming target, called party identity (e.g. SIP 

headers: Request URI, P-Called-Party-Id, To) is used to verify the target. 
For incoming calls to an inbound roaming user from a Non-Local-Id as the target, calling party identity (P-Asserted-Id, 
From) or redirecting party identity (History-Info, Diversion) are used to verify the target. For outgoing calls from an 
inbound roaming user to a Non-Local-Id as the target, the called party identity (Request-URI, To) is used to verify the 

target. See Annex I for an informative illustration of Non-
Local-Id target interception cases. The LMISF will have to 
provide the functions provided by the P-CSCF (Annex I) in the VPLMN. 
20.3.2.2 IMEI-based interception 
To support the IMEI-based interception, the LMISF shall provide (if possible) the functions equivalent to functions 

defined for CSCF in clause 7A.8. 
NOTE: The format of the Instance Id used in clause 7A.8 is under the control of HPLMN. 
20.3.2.3 Mid-call Interception 
The mid-call interception is performed using the procedures de
scribed in clause 7A.3.1 except that LMISF (instead of 
CSCF as described in clause 7A.3.1) maintains the IMS ca
ll state, stores the SIP messages and generates the IRI. 
When a lawfully authorized interception is deactivated while the target is on an IMS session, the LMISF shall stop 

delivering the IRI events to the Delivery Function 2. 
20.3.2.4 Signalling Compression 
If compression of the IMS signalling traffic is detected (as defined in RFC 3320 [69] and RFC 4896 [70]), then the SIP 

messages are first decompressed (as defined in clause 8 of TS 24.229 [49]) and processed with the steps used to process 

the uncompressed SIP messages. 
20.3.2.5 Limitations 
The limitations described in the NOTE of clause 15.4.1 apply to lawful interception capabilities provided in the 

VPLMN for voice services involving the inbound roamers with S8HR as the roaming architecture. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2353GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
20.3.3 X2-Interface 
For the delivery of intercepted SIP messages, the following information shall be passed from the LMISF to the Delivery 
Function 2 on the X2 reference point: 
- Target Identity (SIP URL, TEL URL, IMEI);
 - Correlation Identifier;
 - Event Time and Date;
 - Network Element Identifier;
 - SIP Header;
 - SIP payload. 
The Delivery Function 2 delivers the IRI to the LEMF over the HI2 interface based on the national regulations. 
20.4 Lawful Interception with CUPS architecture   
When Control and User Plane Separated (CUPS) architecture is used for S-GW, the S-GW/BBIFF functions may have 
to be split as shown in figure 20.4. 
 Figure 20.4: CUPS LI architecture for voice services of inbound roamers with S8HR 
The S-GW/BBIFF-C receives the S8HR APN information over the Xib reference point from the LMISF.  
The S-GW/BBIFF-C shall notify the LMISF over the Xib reference point whenever an IMS Signalling Bearer for S8HR 
APN is created, modified or deleted along with the IMSI value of the UE.  
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2363GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
The S-GW/BBIFF-C shall provide packet detection rules wi
th the GTP tunnel Id of the IMS Signalling Bearer 
(associated with S8HR APN) to the S-GW/BBIFF-U with an indication to instruct the S-GW/BBIFF-U to send the IMS 
signalling packets to the LMISF. Acco
rdingly, the S-GW/BBIFF-U shall send the IMS signalling packets to the LMISF 
over the Xia reference point.  
When the CC interception is required, the LMISF would have 
passed on the IMS Signalling Bearer Id of the intercepted 
IMS session to the S-GW/BBIFF-C. The S-GW/BBIFF-C shall determine the GTP tunnel of the Media Bearer linked to 
that IMS Signalling Bearer and pass the packet detection rules with the GTP tunnel Id of the Media Bearer to the S-
GW/BBIFF-U. The S-GW/BBIFF-U shall send the packets of that GTP tunnel (i.e. of Media Bearer) to the LMISF over 

the Xia reference point.   
The method used to transfer the GTP tunnel Id along with the packet delivery indication from S-GW/BBIFF-C to S-
GW/BBIFF-U shall be done as described in subclause 12.9.  
NOTE: The X3c, X3u reference points and the Split X3 LI Interworking Function (SX3LIF) described in 
subclause 12.9 are not used for S8HR LI when a Servin
g Gateway is deployed with CUPS architecture.    
20.5 S8HR LI and Target UE Mobility  
20.5.1 Overview 
During a session (packet data or voice) that involves th
e target UE, the S-GW/BBIFF that provides the IMS Signalling 
packets and Media packets to the LMISF 
can change (i.e. S-GW/BBIFF relocation). 
The lawful interception of voice calls involving the target shall continue when the S-GW/BBIFF relocation happens.  

The IRI events and the CC delivered before and after the relocation shall be correlated.  
20.5.2 S-GW Relocation 
As described in sub-clause 20.1.3.3, the LMISF provides the S8HR APNs to the S-GW/BBIFF and the S-GW/BBIFF 

notifies the LMISF whenever an IMS Signalling Bearer for th
e S8HR APN is created, modified or deleted along with 
the IMSI value of the UE. This happens independently of S-GW relocation. When the IMS signalling packets are 

received from the S-GW/BBIFF, the LMISF delivers the IRI events to the DF2 if the IMS signalling packets are 
associated with an intercepted IMS session, This, also happens independent of S-GW relocation.  
When a target UE is on an IMS session and if the S-GW that has the associated IMS Signalling Bearer changes, the 
IMS Signalling Bearer is created at the new S-GW/BBIFF as well. The new S-GW/BBIFF that notifies the LMISF 

about the IMS Signalling Bearer shall include an indicatio
n in the notification to inform the LMISF that a S-GW 
relocation has occurred.  
The LMISF shall provide the following functions to support the continued and correlated interception for the CC:   
When a notification is received from the S-GW/BBIFF (over the Xib reference point) indicating that an IMS 
Signalling Bearer is created due to
 S-GW relocation, examine to see whether the IMS Signalling Bearer is 
associated with an IMS session that is being intercepted.  
If the IMS Signalling Bearer is associated with an inte
rcepted IMS session, examine to see whether the intercepted 
IMS session requires the CC interception.  
If the intercepted IMS session requires CC interception, inform the S-GW/BBIFF (over the Xib reference point) 
with the IMS Signalling Bearer information (e.g. IMS Sign
alling Bearer ID, IMSI value) with an instruction to 
deliver (to LMISF) the packets from the Media Bear
er associated with the IMS Signalling Bearer.  
The new S-GW/BBIFF delivers the packets from the Media Bear
er associated with the IMS Signalling Bearer to the 
LMISF as described in sub-clause to 20.2.1.2. The LMISF 
delivers the received media packets to the DF3 as CC along 
with the correlation information as described in clause 20.2.1.4. 
The LMISF shall not disrupt the ongoing interception of IRI and CC, if a IMS Signalling Bearer deletion notification is 
received from the old S-GW/BBIFF.

Annex A (informative): 
Information flows for Lawful Inte
rception invocation of circuit 
switched services 
The following figures show the information flows for the invocation of Lawful Interception for various types of calls. 
The figures show some of the basic signalling messages of the target calls and the events on the X2 and X3-interfaces. 

The call control messages to and from the network are shown for informational purposes only; some of them may not 

be sent or may be combined in certain networks. The handling
 of the bearers for the basic calls is not shown. The bearer 
points are established in a manner to minimise content 
loss without delaying the call to the target. The bearer 
establishment to agency will be in parallel or immediately following the bearer establishment to the target. The flows 
portray both forward and backward bearer 
establishment and release to the agency. 
A.1 Mobile originated circuit switched calls 
Figure A.1 shows the interception of a basic mobile originated
 circuit switched speech or data call where the originating 

mobile (A) is the target for interception. B is not necessa
rily also a mobile subscriber and resides on a different

A.5 Call forwarding / call deflection 
A.5.0 General 
The following pictures show the information flows for the interception of forwarded calls. Information flows will be 
given for three typical cases of call forwarding. All other 
types of call forwarding / call deflection are intercepted 
similar to one of these. 
A.5.1 Unconditional call forwarding 
Figure A.7 shows the interception of unconditionally forwarded calls. The mobile that activated unconditional call 
forwarding (B) is the target for interception. In this case 
interception will be performed at the 3G GMSC, where the 
Service Request Indicator (SRI) request for B is issued and 
subsequently the SRI response indicating that the call shall 
be forwarded is received.

A.5.4 Call forwarding on not reachable (no response to 
paging/radio channel failure) 
Call forwarding on not reachable because of no response to paging or radio channel failure is also handled on the 
3G MSC similar to call forwarding on busy (network determined). Interception of this type of call forwarding is 

therefore done in the same way (see clause A.5.3). 
A.5.5 Call forwarding on no reply 
Figure A.9 shows the interception of call forwarding on no reply. The mobile that activated call forwarding on no reply 

(B) is the target for interception. In this case interception 
will be performed at the 3G MSC where B resides, where the 
no reply condition is detected and the call is forwarded. Initially, the interception is similar to the interception of a basic
 mobile terminated circuit switched speech of data call. On no reply time-out, the interception will continue on the 

forwarded call to C.

 Figure A.9: Interception of call forwarding on no reply 
In figure A.9 the release of the stublines is done after the forwarded call is released by A or C. It is a national option not 
to support interception of forwarded calls. In that case, the release of the stublines is done after the call is forwarded and 

B is no longer involved. 
A.5.6 Call forwarding on busy (user determined)/call deflection 
Call forwarding on busy (user determined) and call deflect
ion are also handled on the 3G MSC similar to call 
forwarding on no reply. Interception of this type of call forwarding is therefore done in the same way (see A5.5).

A.5.7 Call waiting / call forwarding on no reply 
Figures A.10 and A.11 show the interception of a call involving both call waiting and call forwarding on no reply. 
Figure A.10 covers the case where one pair of stublines is used per target, figure A.11 covers the case where a separate 
pair of stublines is used for each target call. The mobile
 that activated call forwarding on no reply and receives the 
waiting call (B) is the target for interception. In figure A.10 a new pair of stublines needs to be set up when the call is 
forwarded since the first pair of stublines is still used for the initial call.

Annex C (informative): 
Information flows for the invoca
tion of Lawful Interception for 
Packet Data with multimedia 
C.0 General 
The following figures show the information flows for the invocation of Lawful Interception for Packet Data with 
multimedia. The figures show some of the basic signalling messages of the target Packet Data communication and the 

events on the X2 interfaces. The dotted lines indicate signalling depending on whether IRI information has been 
requested. The figures illustrate interception in the visited network. 
The figures in this annex only apply to scenarios where the 
P-CSCF is located in the visited network. In some operator 
deployment scenarios, the P-CSCF will be in the Home Network. Where the P-CSCF is located in the Home Network 
and UE to P-CSCF signalling encryption is applied, all SIP messages between the P-CSCF and the UE will be 

encrypted within the visited network and therefore plain text interception in the visited network may not be possible. 
C.1 Multimedia registration 
Figures C.1.1 and C.1.2 show the intercept of the Multimedia registration for the case of visited network interception 

(refer to TS 23.228 [43] clauses 5.3.2.4 and 5.3.2.5).

Annex E (Informative): 
IMS-based VoIP Lawful Interception call scenarios 
E.1 Overview 
This informative annex provides the examples of call scen
arios that illustrate the interception and delivery of CC 
interception for an IMS-based VoIP call. 
E.2 Background One of the use-cases of IMS-based VoIP service is VoLTE. The term "VoLTE" is used to refer to an IMS-based VoIP 
service when EPS (see TS 23.401 [22]) happens to be the access network. When EPS is not the access network, the 

lawful interception capabilities defined in this informative annex applies for any IMS-based VoIP service with the 
presumption that in those cases the media on the target's access goes through an IMS-AGW (see TS 29.334 [42]) or a 
PDN-GW (see TS 23.401 [22] and TS 23.402 [23]) or a GGSN (UMTS network). 
NOTE 1: Void. 
Even with the EPS-based access network, the media might still go through the IMS-AGW. And, in this case, a VoLTE 

shall be treated very similar to any other VoIP service. 
Furthermore, it is presumed that an inter-CSP call enters or leaves an IMS network via an IBCF/TrGW or an 
MGCF/IM-MGW depending on whether the inter-working CSP network is an IMS-based network or a CS-based 
network (see TS 23.228 [43]). Also, for an IMS roaming scenario, it is presumed that the signalling and media enters or 

leaves the home CSP through the IBCF/TrGW. 
The figure E.1 illustrates the VoIP configuration considered for the lawful interception capabilities defined in this 
clause: 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2683GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
  Figure E.1: IMS-based VoIP Configuration 
NOTE 2: The configuration scenario where the media doe
s not go through the GGSN, or PDN-GW or the IMS-
AGW is outside the scope of this document. 
NOTE 3: Void. 
In the remaining part of this informative annex, the PDN-GW
/GGSN are shown in one box and is to be read as either 
the GGSN (UMTS) or the PDN-GW (EPS). 
In figure E.1, the term "media node" is used to denote the network node present on media path and the term "signalling 
node" is used to denote the network node present on the signalling path. 
The general concepts of VoIP LI is shown in figure E.2 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)2693GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
  Figure E.2: General Principles of VoIP Interception 
In clause 15, the SIP signalling nodes provide signalling information to the CC Interception Triggering Function. The 
CC Interception Triggering Function triggers the CC interception at a media node that implements the CC Intercept 
Function. 
The following functional elements provide the CC Inte
rcept Function in the example call scenarios: 
- PDN-GW/GGSN; 

- IMS-AGW; 

- TrGW; 
- IM-MGW 
- MRF. 
The following functional elements provide the signalling to the CC Intercept Triggering Function: 
- P-CSCF for PDN-GW/GGSN and IMS-AGW; 

- IBCF for TrGW; 

- MGCF for IM-MGW 
- S-CSCF for MRF. 
At any given time, for a specific target and for any given call, only one functional element is required to provide the CC 
interception. The functional element that provides the CC interception may vary, primarily, based on the CSP network 

implementation and the call scenario.

E.3.1 Originating Call from the Target with CC Interception at the 
MRF Figure E.3.1 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the interception and delivery of IRI and CC when 
a target originates a call with an MRF providing the CC 
interception. The S-CSCF provides the CC Interception 
Triggering Function for the MRF.

The cloud shown with the label "voice services" indicates that the target is making a voice call and the called party can 

be within the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. 
IRI interception is done at the S-CSCF. The CC interception is done at an MRF that functions as the CC ICE. 

The MRF is deployed in a network configuration with an IP
 border access controller that serves to hide the presence of 
the MRF. The IP access border controller supports IP-level 
topology hiding for any voice 
media streams. Specifically, 
the border gateway supports NAT functionality; always presents its own IP address to the user; prevents ICMP Ping & 
ICMP Traceroute requests from being forwarded across the gateway; and, resets TTL field in the IP header. 
NOTE 3.1: MRF is defined in TS 23.228 [43]. 
The ADF activates interception at the S-CSCF for IRI inte
rception and CC interception using the same target identity 
(SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI). The S-CSCF dynamically triggers CC interception at the MRF for the call.

E.7 Intra-CSP Forwarded Call with CC Interception at the 
PDN-GW/GGSN 
E.7.0 General 
Figure E.7 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a 
target receives an incoming call with PDN-GW/GGSN prov
iding the CC interception an
d the call is forwarded to 
another IMS subscriber within the CSP's network. 
  Figure E.7: VoIP lawful interception for an intra-CSP forwarded call with CC interception at the PDN-
GW/GGSN 
The cloud shown with the label "voice services" is to indicat
e that the target is receiving an incoming voice call and the 
calling party can be within the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as I-CSCF, 

HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the 
target and to the forwarded-to-party are not shown for 
simplification of the drawing. 
Figure E.7 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF
 or AS. In this scenario, the IRI interception cannot occur 
in the P-CSCF since the P-CSCF that provides the proxy functions to the target is not on the signalling path. The CC

E.7.1 Intra-CSP Forwarded Call with CC Interception at the MRF 
Figure E.7.1 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when 
a target receives an incoming call with the MRF providing th
e CC interception and the call is forwarded to another IMS 
subscriber within the CSP's network. The S-CSCF provid
es the CC Interception Triggering Function for the MRF. 
The MRF is deployed in a network configuration with an IP
 border access controller that serves to hide the presence of 
the MRF. The IP access border controller supports IP-level 
topology hiding for any voice 
media streams. Specifically, 
the border gateway supports NAT functionality; always presents its own IP address to the user; prevents ICMP Ping & 

ICMP Traceroute requests from being forwarded across the gateway; and, resets TTL field in the IP header. 
 Figure E.7.1: VoIP lawful interception for an intra-CSP forwarded call with CC interception at the MRF 
The cloud shown with the label "voice services" is to indicat
e that the target is receiving an incoming voice call and the 
calling party can be within the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as P-CSCF, 

IMS-AGW, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call 
to the target and to the forwarded-to-party are not shown 
for simplification of the drawing. 
Figure E.7.1 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CS
CF. The CC interception is done at the MRF that functions 
as the CC ICE. 

The ADMF activates interception at the S-CSCF for IRI inte
rception and CC interception using the same target identity 
(SIP URI or TEL URI). The S-CSCF dynamically activates CC interception at the MRF.

Annex F (informative): 
Examples of IMS-based VoIP Lawful Interception (LI) call 
flows 
F.1 General remarks 
All the call flows illustrate that the CC delivery begins once the SDP offer and answer is completed (i.e., when the 
media bearer is setup). In all the call flows, the first reliable response is SIP 200 OK. 
In all the call flows, the originating end of the call sends the SDP offer and terminating end gives the SDP answer. 
Since, the first reliable response is SIP 200 OK, the SDP answer is always given in the SIP 200 OK message. 
The call flows assume that per clause 7.A, the IRI for VoIP is nothing but the delivery encapsulated SIP messages. The 
call flows do not show the method used for correlating the IRI with IRI and IRI with CC. It is presumed that those are 

stage 3 details. 
All the call flows assume the presence of a Voice Application 
Server (shown as AS) that provides the voice services 
like digit translation, invoking the call forwarding, etc. 
IRI in the visited CSP is intercepted by the P-CSCF and IRI in the home CSP is intercepted by the S-CSCF. 

The call flows show that CC interception is done at the IP-CAN (and it should be interpreted to mean that the 
interception is done in the PDN-GW or GGSN depending on th
e packet core network), or at the TrGW or at the IM-
MGW. The other possible CC interception options (e.g., IMS-AGW) are not shown. 
Not all the functional elements are shown in the call flows.
 For example, the call flows do not show I-CSCF, HSS, 
PCRF. 

All the call flows show a summary of SIP messages that are delivered to the LEA (not all SIP messages are shown). The 
term LEMF, used in some call flows, means it is an equivalent of LEA. 
For each call flow, references are required to identify MMT
EL service that it illustrates (for further study).

This clause gives 3 call flows to illustrate the case of IMS roaming. 
Figure F.8 illustrate the case where the roaming target originates a call. Here, roaming target (Party_A) calls Party_B 
who is served by the same CSP as that of target. Party_B is not roaming. 
Figure F.8A illustrates the case where a roaming target or
iginates a call with local breakout approach is used for 
roaming. In this case, home CSP of Party-B happens to be visited CSP where the target is roaming and hence, the media 
does not enter the HPLMN of target (i.e., Home CSP of target). A Home CSP reports the CC unavailability to the 

LEMF with "roaming" as the reason for CC unavailability. 
Figure F.9 illustrates the case where a roaming target receives an incoming call. Here, non-roaming Party_A, who is 
served by the same CSP as that of target, calls the target (Party_B).

F.6 Interception in Visited CSP 
F.6.0 General 
This clause gives 3 call flows to illustrate the case of interception in the visited CSP. In all these flows, the IRI 
interception happens at the P-CSCF. Both IRI and CC interception happen in the visited CSP. 
Figure F.10 illustrates the case where the target (Party_A) in the visited CSP originates a call dialing a special number. 
The special number is translated into Party_B in the home
 CSP. The flow also assumes that the interception is done 
only in the visited CSP. 
Figure F.11 illustrates the case where the target (Party_B) in the visited CSP receives an incoming call from Party_A 
served by the same Home CSP. The flow assumes that the interception is done only in the visited CSP. 
Figure F.12 illustrates the case where an incoming call to the target (Party_B) gets forwarded in the Home CSP due to 
call forwarding no answer. The flow also assumes that the interception is done only in the visited CSP.

F.7 Ad-Hoc Conference Calls established by the Target 
F.7.0 Introduction 
This clause gives 9 call flows to illustrate the steps related to ad-hoc conference calling established by the target. The 
flows assume that the Party_A (target) has already made tw
o calls, one to Party_B and one to Party_C, and placed both 
calls on hold so as to merge the two calls into a conference. 
Figure F.7.1 illustrates the case where the Party_A (target) creates the conference. 

Figure F.7.2 and Figure F.7.3 illustrate the case where the Party_A (target) brings the Party_C into the conference. 

Figure F.7.4 and F.7.5 illustrate the case where the Party_A (target) brings the Party_B into the conference. 

Figure F.7.6 illustrates the case where Party_C drops out of the conference call. 
Figure F.7.7 illustrates the case where the call between two parties (Party_A (target) and Party_B) is converted back to 
a normal 2-party call. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3023GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
Figure F.7.8 illustrates the case where Party_A (target) places the conference on hold. 
Figure F.7.9 illustrates the case where Party_A (target) retrieves the held conference from hold. 

Some of the steps may be executed by the target's UE automatically (in other words, no action is required by the target). 
For example, when the target tries to merge the call, the target's UE may execute the steps shown in Figure F.7.1, Figure 

F.7.2, Figure F.7.3, Figure F.7.4, Figure F.7.5 automatically 
in a serial fashion. The same way, the steps shown in 
Figure F.7.7 may be executed automatically after the steps shown in Figure F.7.6 when one of the conferees drop out of 
the conference. 
The Figure F.7.8 and Figure F.7.9 are not really part of the conferencing steps, however, included here to show how the 
content of a held conference call (a requirement in some countries) is delivered to the LEAs.

Annex G (informative): 
Examples of CC interception for transcoded media 
G.1 Introduction 
This annex provides some illustrative examples of media transcoding scenarios and its implication on the CC 
interception. 
In some situations, the media information known to the S-CS
CF can be different from the media information associated 
with the CC delivered to the LEMF. For example, when
 transcoding is involved in the media path, the media 
information (e.g., codec used) can change at the time transc
oding is done and the S-CSCF that normally provides the 
media information to the DF2 may not have the knowledge of media information associated with the CC delivered to 
the LEMF. 
In a particular implementation, the CC interception point may be
 chosen in such a way that information associated with 
the intercepted CC always matches to the information known to the IRI ICE (e.g., S-CSCF). But, there may some 
deployment situations and/or regulations that may require having a need to perform the CC interception at the other 

points with the information known to S-CSCF not being aligned with the information associated with the intercepted 
CC. 
G.2 CC Interception of transcoded media 
The Figure G.2-1 illustrates a case where the media is transcoded at the IMS-AGW. In this example, the media is not 
encrypted. 
 Figure G.2-1: Transcoded Media 
The Figure G.2-1 shows three different cases of CC interception
 points. In the illustrated example, Codec 1 is associated 
with the media from the Target to the Ingress point of IMS-AGW and Codec 2 is used from the Egress point of IMS-

AGW and beyond. Therefore, Codec 1 is associated with the 
CC delivered to the LEMF when that CC is intercepted at 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3123GPP TS 33.107 ve
rsion 14.2.0 Release 14
the PDN-GW or at the Ingress point of IMS-AGW, and Codec 
2 is associated with the media delivered to the LEMF 
when that CC is intercepted at the Egress point of IMS-AGW. 
The Codec 2 is included within the SDP of SIP messages hand
led at the S-CSCF and therefore, if S-CSCF provides the 
codec information to the DF2 in all cases, then there would be a misalignment with the codec information delivered 
over the HI2 and codec information associated with the CC delivered over HI3 for Case 1 and Case 2. 
Depending on which case is used for the CC interception, th
e P-CSCF can send either Codec 1 or Codec 2 to the DF2. 
With the DF2 using the codec information received from 
the P-CSCF for reporting purposes, the codec information 
reported in the HI2 and HI3 are now aligned. For case 3, th
e codec information would be aligned irrespective of who 
sends that information to the DF2. Therefore, for Case 3, 
P-CSCF sending the codec 2 information to the DF2 can be an 
implementation alternative. 

In a scenario like this, an implementation can also be such th
at the CC interception is always done at the Egress point of 
IMS-AGW (i.e., only Case 3), but because of some deployment situations and regulations, there may also be a need to 
perform the CC interception at the Ingress point of
 IMS-AGW (Case 2) or at the PDN-GW (Case 1). 
G.3 CC Interception of transcoded media with e2ae 
encryption 
The Figure G.3-1 illustrates a case where the media is transcoded at IMS-AGW with e2ae encryption. In this example, 
media is encrypted e2ae (i.e. between the Target and the Ingress point of IMS-AGW). The CC is delivered to the LEMF 
in a decrypted form. 
 Figure G.3-1: Transcoded Media with e2ae encryption 
The Figure G.3-1 shows three different cases of CC interception 
points. In this example, Codec 1 is associated with the 
media from the Target to the Ingress point of IMS-AGW and Codec 2 is used from the Egress point of IMS-AGW and 

beyond. Therefore, Codec 1 is associated with the CC delive
red to the LEMF when that CC is intercepted at the PDN-
GW or at the Ingress point of IMS-AGW, and Codec 2 is as
sociated with the media delivered to the LEMF when that 
CC is intercepted at the Egress point of IMS-AGW. The Codec 2 is included within the SDP of SIP messages handled 

at the S-CSCF and therefore, if S-CSCF provides the codec 
information to the DF2 in all cases, then there would be a 
misalignment with the codec information delivered over 
the HI2 and codec information associated with the CC 
delivered over HI3 for Case 1 and Case 2. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3133GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
Depending on which case is used for the CC interception, th
e P-CSCF can send either Codec 1 or Codec 2 to the DF2. 
With the DF2 using the codec information received from 
the P-CSCF for reporting purposes, the codec information 
reported in the HI2 and HI3 are now aligned. For case 3, th
e codec information would be aligned irrespective of who 
sends that information to the DF2. Therefore, for Case 3, 
P-CSCF sending the codec 2 information to the DF2 can be an 
implementation alternative. 
In this example, media is encrypted (with SDES keys in SDP) from Target to the Ingress point of IMS-AGW and not 
encrypted from the Egress point of IMS-AGW and beyond. Therefore, for Case 1 and Case 2, the DF2 has to provide 
the SDES keys to the DF3 (see clause 7A.1.A) to perform 
the decryption. The S-CSCF does not receive the SDES keys 
within the SDP of SIP messages. Therefore, P-CSCF shall send the SDES Keys to the DF2 and the DF2 shall use that 

for its handling (i.e., sending to the DF3). P-CSCF does not send any SDES Keys to the DF2 for Case 3 since the CC is 

intercepted in the Egress point of IMS-AGW in a decrypted form. 
In a scenario like this, an implementation can also be such th
at the CC interception is always done at the Egress point of 
IMS-AGW (i.e., only Case 3), but because of some deployment situations and regulations, there may also be a need to 
perform the CC interception at the Ingress point of
 IMS-AGW (Case 2) or at the PDN-GW (Case 1). 
G.4 CC Interception of transcoded media with e2e hop-
by-hop encryption 
The Figure G.4-1 illustrates a case where the media is transcoded at IMS-AGW with e2e hop-by-hop encryption. 

Different SDES keys are for the encryption. 
 Figure G.4-1: Transcoded Media with e2e encryption 
The Figure G.4-1 shows three different cases of CC interception 
points. In this example, Codec 1 is associated with the 
media from the Target to the Ingress point of IMS-AGW and Codec 2 is used from Egress point of IMS-AGW and 

beyond. Therefore, Codec 1 is associated with the CC deliver
ed to the LEMF when that CC is intercepted at the PDN-
GW or at the Ingress point of IMS-AGW, and Codec 2 is as
sociated with the media delivered to the LEMF when that 
CC is intercepted at the Egress point of IMS-AGW. The Codec 2 is included within the SDP of SIP messages handled 

at the S-CSCF and therefore, if S-CSCF provides the codec 
information to the DF2 in all cases, then there would be a 
misalignment with the codec information delivered over 
the HI2 and codec information associated with the CC 
delivered over HI3 for Case 1 and Case 2. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3143GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
Depending on which case is used for the CC interception, th
e P-CSCF can send either Codec 1 or Codec 2 to the DF2. 
With the DF2 using the codec information received from 
the P-CSCF for reporting purposes, the codec information 
reported in the HI2 and HI3 are now aligned. For case 3, th
e codec information would be aligned irrespective of who 
sends that information to the DF2. Therefore, for Case 3, 
P-CSCF sending the codec 2 information to the DF2 can be an 
implementation alternative. 
The media is encrypted (with SDES keys in SDP) from Target to the Ingress point of IMS-AGW with SDES keyes-1 as 
the encryption keys and encrypted from Egress point of IMS-AGW to the other end using SDES keys-2 as the 
encryption keys. The S-CSCF is aware of only the SDES keys-2 as it sees that in the SDP of the SIP messages. For 

Case 1 and Case 2, the P-CSCF shall provide the SDES keys to the DF2. For Case 3, either of the two, S-CSCF or the 

P-CSCF, can send the SDES keys to the DF2. DF2 has to use the SDES keys received from the P-CSCF for its handling 

(i.e., sending it to DF3) to perform the decryption. For Case 3, if the P-CSCF does not send the SDES Keys to the DF2, 
then the DF2 will use the SDES keys received from the S-CSCF for its handling. 
In a scenario like this, an implementation can also be such th
at the CC interception is always done at the Egress point of 
IMS-AGW (i.e., only Case 3), but because of some deployment situations and regulations, there may also be a need to 
perform the CC interception at the Ingress point of
 IMS-AGW (Case 2) or at the PDN-GW (Case 1). 
G.5 CC Interception of transcoded media at the TrGW 
The Figure G.5-1 illustrates a case where the media is transcoded at TrGW. In this example, the TrGW provides the 

transcoding. This scenario can be see when an incoming call to
 the Target is forwarded (illustration assumes) or when 
Target is IMS roaming. 
 Figure G.5-1: TrGW Transcoded Media 
The Figure G.5-1 shows two different cases of CC interception points. In this example, Codec 1 is associated with the 

media from the first Other Party (e.g., calling party) to the Ingress point of TrGW and Codec 2 is used from Egress 

point of TrGW to the second Other Party (e.g., forwarded-to-party). Therefore, Codec 1 is associated with the CC 
delivered to the LEMF when that CC is intercepted at Ingr
ess point of TrGW and Codec 2 is associated with the media 
delivered to the LEMF when that CC is intercepted at th
e Egress point of TrGW. The Codec 1 is included within the 
SDP of SIP messages handled at the S-CSCF and therefore, if S-CSCF provides that to the DF2 in both cases, there 
would be a misalignment with the codec information delivere
d over the HI2 and codec information associated with the 
CC delivered over HI3 for Case 2. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3153GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
Depending on which case is used for the CC interception, 
the IBCF can send either Codec 1 or Codec 2 to the DF2. 
With the DF2 using the codec information received from 
the IBCF for reporting purposes, the codec information 
reported in the HI2 and HI3 are now aligned. For Case 1 the codec information would be aligned irrespective of who 
sends that information to the DF2. Therefore, for Case 1, 
IBCF sending the codec 1 information to the DF2 can be an 
implementation alternative. 
In a scenario like this, an implementation can also be such 
that the CC interception is always done at the Ingress point 
of TrGW (i.e., only Case 1), but because of some deployment situations and/or regulations, there may also be a need to 
perform the CC interception at the Egress point of TrGW as well.

Annex H (informative): 
Location only warrant 
H.1 General 
The following describes the information that is delivered for authorization in those countries that allow authorized 
Lawful Interception (LI) for location scenarios. 
H.2 Location only warrant 
The ADMF provides the network and/ or LI LCS Client to
 collect location IRI against a target with a specified 
periodicity. The target may have several interception invocations with multiple LEAs. For an Authorization for location 

reporting, all other IRI's not associated with Location is filtered. For example if a target places a voice call, new location 
information is now available to be sent to the LEA with a location authorization, that location data, and only the 
location value can be sent to the LEA, any record of the even
t (call start and other associated event information) is not 
be sent. Other LEAs may have a warrant for the Voice Services, and they will get the associated IRI. The invocations of 

elements to be captured can be sent to the DF and/ or the MF can filter events not required for the Location 

Authorization 
H.3 Immediate Location warrant 
The ADMF provides the network and/ or LI LCS Client to 
collect the immediate location of a target. The target may 
have several interception invocations with multiple LEAs. For an Authorization for Immediate location, all other IRI's 
not associated with Location is filtered.

Annex I (informative): 
Interception of Targets with Non-Local IDs 
I.1 Introduction 
This annex provides some informative illustrations on the interception of targets with Non-Local IDs. A target with a 
Non-Local ID means that the identity used for the target
 may not belong to the network that is providing the 
interception. However, in a roaming scen
ario, that subscriber with a Non-Local ID could as well be in the network 
where the interception is provid
ed. For the lawful interception purpose, a 
target with a Non-Local ID is distinctly 
identified as a Non-Local target along with the nature of the 
interception that is required to be performed on that target. 
This clause covers only the IRI aspects of interception capabilities since the capabilities to perform the CC interception 

do not change. 
I.2 Interception of outgoing calls 
I.2.1 General 
In order to perform the interception of outgoing calls to a particular destination (identified as target with Non-Local ID 

for outgoing calls), called party information of the outgoing message is checked. 
In the CS domain, this could be the Called Party Information present in the IAM message (as an example) that is sent 
from the switch that performs the interception. 
In the case of IMS-based VoIP calls, this can be any of th
e SIP headers used to identif
y the called party information 
present in the outgoing SIP message. The examples are: Re
quest URI and To headers. The interception functions may 
be provided by the S-CSCF or P-CSCF (optional in a non-roaming case, and mandatory in the roaming case when LBO 
approach is used as the roaming architecture). Alternativel
y, in another implementation, the interception functions may 
also be provided by the Egress IBCF or Egress MGCF for a non-roaming case. Of the two approaches S-CSCF/P-CSCF 

Vs IBCF/MGCF used for non-roaming case, only one approach is required to be supported within a CSP's network. 
I.2.2 Interception at S-CSCF or P-CSCF 
The Figure I.1 shows an example where the interception is done at the S-CSCF. The Figure I.2 shows an example where 

the interception is done at the P-CSCF 
in a roaming case with LBO as the roaming architecture. In both illustrations, 
Party-B is the target with Non-Local ID and the nature of the interception to be performed is for outgoing calls. In the 

call, the Request URI and To headers point to Party-B. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3183GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
  Figure I.1: IRI ICE at S-CSCF - interception of a target with Non-Local ID for outgoing calls 
Figure I.1 shows the case where S-CSCF is the IRI ICE and hence, the S-CSCF checks the Request URI and To headers 
of SIP message that it sends out toward IBCF/MGCF. Since a match is found, S-CSCF would perform the interception. 
In the event, multiple S-CSCF are involved in the signalling path (due to call forwarding case), all S-CSCF are expected 
to do the same check and the S-CSCF closer to the Egress IBCF/MGCF will find a match. It is important to note that 

the S-CSCF checks the headers from the SIP message it sends out because the Request URI of the SIP message it 

receives will be pointing to the local ID (which may have the call forwarding activated). 
As in the case of interception of target with Local ID, a 
P-CSCF may optionally provide the IRI ICE functions in a non-
roaming case. However, in a roaming case with LBO as 
the roaming architecture, P-CSCF provides the IRI ICE 
functions. 
 Figure I.2: IRI ICE at P-CSCF (roaming) - interception of a target with Non-Local ID for outgoing calls 
In Figure I.2, the P-CSCF in the VPLMN checks the Request URI and To headers of SIP message that it sends out 
toward IBCF. Since a match is found, P-CSCF would perform the interception. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 1
07 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3193GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
I.2.3 Interception at the IBCF/MGCF 
The Figure I.3 shows an example where the interception is done at the IBCF or MGCF in a non-roaming case. In the 
illustration, Party-B is the target with Non-Local ID and the nature of the interception to be performed is for outgoing 
calls. In the call, the Request URI and To headers point to Party-B. 
 Figure I.3: IRI ICE at BCF - interception of a target with Non-Local ID for outgoing calls 
Figure I.3 shows the case where the Egress IBCF or MGCF is 
the IRI ICE for intercepting when the target is identified 
with a Non-Local ID. Accordingly, the IBCF or MGCF checks the Request URI and To headers of SIP message. Since 
MGCF is providing signalling conversion (e.g., SIP to ISUP
 and Vice-Versa), the MGCF checks the headers of the SIP 
message it receives. IBCF could check the headers from either of the SIP messages (they have to be the same anyway). 

Alternatively, the MGCF could also check the Called Party Information present in the IAM it sends out. 
I.3 Interception of incoming calls 
I.3.1 General 
In order to perform the interception of incoming calls from a particular origination point (identified as target with Non-

Local ID for incoming calls), calling party information and 
redirecting party information of the incoming message are 
checked. The redirecting information is checked because the call may have encountered a call forwarding before 
arriving at the CSP where the interception for Non-Local ID is performed. 
In the CS domain, this could be the Calling Party Information and Redirecting Party Information present in the IAM 
message (as an example) that is received at the switch where the interception is performed. 
In the case of IMS-based VoIP calls, this can be any of the SIP headers used to identify the calling party information 
and redirecting party information present in the incoming SI
P message. The examples are: P-Asserted Id, From headers 
and History-Info, Diversion headers. The interception functions may be provided by the S-CSCF or P-CSCF (optional 

in a non-roaming case and mandatory in the roaming case wh
en LBO approach is used as the roaming architecture). 
Alternatively, in another implementation, the interception functions may also be provided by the Ingress IBCF or 

Ingress MGCF for non-roaming case. Of the two approaches S-CSCF/P-CSCF Vs IBCF/MGCF used for non-roaming 

case, only one approach is required to be supported within a CSP's network. 
I.3.2 Interception at S-CSCF or P-CSCF 
The Figure I.4 shows an example where the interception is done at the S-CSCF. The Figure I.5 shows an example where 

the interception is done at the P-CSCF 
in a roaming case with LBO as the roaming architecture. In both illustrations, 
Party-A is the target with Non-Local ID and the nature of the interception to be performed is for incoming calls. In the 
call, the P-Asserted-Id, From headers point to Party-A. Ther
e are no History-Info or Diversion headers in the examples. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3203GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
 Figure I.4: IRI ICE at S-CSCF - interception of a target with Non-Local ID for incoming calls 
Figure I.4 shows the case where S-CSCF is the IRI ICE and hence, the S-CSCF checks the P-Asserted-Id and From 
headers of SIP message that it receives from the I-CSCF. Since a match is found, S-CSCF would perform the 
interception. In the event, multiple S-CSCF are involved in the signalling path (due to call forwarding case), all S-

CSCFs may to do the same check and all S-CSCFs may end up finding a match to the target's Non-Local ID. Special 

care will have to be taken to suppress the duplicate interception of one LI request. When a call forwarding is involved, 

the subsequent S-CSCF may see History-Info or Diversion h
eaders present, however, none of those are expected to 
match the Non-Local ID of the target. As in the case of interception of target with Local ID, a P-CSCF may optionally 
provide the IRI ICE functions in a non-roaming case. 
However, in a roaming case with LBO as the roaming 
architecture, P-CSCF provides the IRI ICE functions. 
 Figure I.5: IRI ICE at P-CSCF (roaming) - interception
 of a target with Non-Local ID for incoming calls 
In Figure I.5, the P-CSCF in the VPLMN checks the P-Asserted-Id, From headers and History-Info and Diversion 
headers of the SIP message that it receives. Since a match is found for P-Asserted-Id and From header values, P-CSCF 

would perform the interception. 
I.3.3 Interception at the IBCF/MGCF 
The Figure I.6 shows an example where the interception is done at the IBCF or MGCF in a non-roaming case. In the 

illustration, Party-A is the target with Non-Local ID and the nature of the interception to be performed is for incoming 
calls. In the call, the P-Asserted-Id and From headers point to
 Party-A. There are no History-Info or Diversion headers 
in the example.

Figure I.6 shows the case where the Ingress IBCF or MGCF is 
the IRI ICE for intercepting when the target is identified 
with a Non-Local ID. Accordingly, the IBCF or MGCF checks the P-Asserted-Id, From headers, and History-Info, 

Diversion headers of SIP message. Since MGCF is providi
ng signalling conversion (e.g., ISUP to SIP and Vice-Versa), 
the MGCF checks the headers of the SIP message it sends out. IBCF could check the headers from either of the SIP 

messages (they have to be the same anyway). Alternatively, the MGCF could also check the Calling Party Information 
and Redirecting Information present in the IAM message that it receives.

Annex J (informative): 
Lawful Interception Illustra
tions in VPLMN with S8HR 
J.1 Overview 
This informative annex illustrates the process of performing lawful interception in the VPLMN for voice services 
involving the inbound roaming targets when S8HR 
approach is used as the roaming architecture. 
When S8HR approach is used as the roaming architecture fo
r VoLTE, all of the IMS nodes reside in the HPLMN. Even 
the PDN-GW resides in the HPLMN. In this case, the lawful interception of voice services involving the inbound 

roaming targets requires new capabilities in the VPLMN since the VPLMN does not have any IMS nodes. New LI-
specific functions are introduced to examine the packets that flow through the VPLMN packet core network nodes to 
generate IRI and CC when the communication involves an inbound roaming target. The LI architecture diagram shown 

in figure 1j is expanded in figure J.1 that shows an overview of S8HR roaming architecture as well.

Figure J.1 Lawful interception of voice services in VPLMN for S8HR 
As shown in figure J.1, the SIP signalling messages are exchanged between the UE and P-CSCF over the Gm reference 
point. Within the VPLMN with S8HR, the IMS signalling messages are carried over the GTP tunnel that corresponds to 

the IMS Signalling Bearer and the media packets are carried over the GTP tunnel that corresponds to the Media Bearer 

(i.e., dedicated EPS Bearer used to carry the media packets). The present document assumes that the EPS Bearer ID of 

the IMS Signalling Bearer is always linked to th
e dedicated EPS Bearer used as a Media Bearer. 
J.2 Process Flow 
The basic concept is LMISF instructs the S-GW/BBIFF over 
the Xib reference point to deliver packets from the GTP 
tunnels associated with IMS signalling bearer of all inbound roamers with S8HR as the roaming architecture. S-

GW/BBIFF extracts the packets from those GTP tunnels and delivers the same to the LMISF. The LMISF extracts the 

SIP messages from those packets and provides an IMS call state function similar to the way P-CSCF provides the IMS 

call state function. In addition, the LMISF provisioned with the target identity by ADMF examines the SIP messages to 
determine whether the IMS session needs to be intercepted. 
When the IMS session needs to be intercepted, the LMISF 
generates IRI from the SIP messages and deliver the same to the Delivery Function 2 over X2 reference point. In 
addition to the generation and delivery of IRI, when CC interception is required, the LMISF also informs the S-

GW/BBIFF that the IMS session is being intercepted and in
structs the S-GW/BBIFF over Xib reference point to start 
delivering the packets from the Media Bearer l associat
ed with the intercepted IM
S Signalling Bearer. The S-

GW/BBIFF extracts the packets from that GTP tunnel used 
for Media Bearer associated with the intercepted IMS 
Signalling Bearer and delivers the same to the LMISF. The 
LMISF constructs the CC from those packets and delivers 
the same to the Delivery Function 3 over X3 reference point. 
Figure J.2 shows the steps to illustrate the process flow:

1. LMISF is provisioned with target information (for Voice Services, it can be SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI) from 
the ADMF. 
2. LMISF instructs the S-GW/BBIFF to notify (to LMI
SF), based on the GTP-C event, whenever an IMS 
Signalling Bearer for S8HR APN is created, modified, or 
deleted, and to deliver the packets (to LMISF) of all 
IMS Signalling Bearers established for S8HR APNs (Access Point Names). Here, the LMISF may supply the 
S8HR APNs to the S-GW/BBIFF. 
NOTE1: This step is independent of target specific LI service operation such as Step 1. 
3 S-GW/BBIFF to notifies the LMISF, based on the GTP-
C event, whenever the IMS Signalling Bearer for S8HR 
APN is created, modified, or deleted 
NOTE2: The S-GW/BBIFF includes the IMSI value associated with the inbound roamer's UE when notifies (to the 
LMISF) creation, modification or deletion of IMS Signalling Bearer for S8HR APN. 
4. S-GW/BBIFF delivers the packets of those IMS Signalli
ng Bearers to the LMISF. As such, S-GW/BBIFF has no 
idea whether the packets of an IMS Signalling Bearer are rela
ted to a target or not. It simply delivers all packets. 
5. The LMISF looks for the SIP message within those packets delivered by the S-GW/BBIFF and examines the SIP 
headers that carry the calling party identity or called pa
rty identity (depending on the call direction) to verify 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3263GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
whether any of those match with the target identity stor
ed locally. If the SIP message corresponds to a target, 
then the LMISF delivers the SIP message to the DF2 over the X2 reference point. 
6. The DF2 will generate and deliver the IRI to the LEMF as per TS 33.108 [11]. 
The following steps are performed only if CC interception is required. 

7. The LMISF then informs the S--GW/BBIFF about the IMS 
Signalling Bearer that corresponds to intercepted 
IMS session and instructs the S-GW/BBIFF to start delivering (to LMISF) the packets of the Media Bearers 
associated with that IMS Signalling Bearer. 
NOTE 3: Step 7 is executed in parallel to step 5. 
8. S-GW/BBIFF delivers the media packets to the LMI
SF. The S-GW/BBIFF knows that the media packets are 
related to an IMS Signalling Bearer, but does not know which media packet is related to which IMS session in 
the event target is involved in multiple sessions. The S-GW/BBIFF need not know that association. 
9. LMISF looks at the media packets that it receives and 
examines the IP address and the port number associated 
with the RTP stream. Then LMISF will determine the associated IMS session comparing the IP address/port 

number of the RTP stream with the similar information 
from the IMS session. LMISF delivers the media packets 
to DF3 along with the Correlation Number it has used while delivering the SIP messages to DF2. 
10. DF3 generates and delivers the CC as per TS 33.108 [11] to the LEMF.

The LMISF will stop generation of IRI and CC immediately

The following steps may be required if CC interception is applicable. 
2. The LMISF informs the S-GW/BBIFF about the identity of
 the IMS Signalling Bearer on which the interception 
is stopped and instructs the S-GW/BBIFF to stop delivering the packets of the Media Bearers associated to that 
IMS Signalling Bearer to LMISF. 
The S-GW/BBIFF will stop delivering the media packets associ
ated with the intercepted IMS Signalling Bearer to

J.3 Call Flows 
J.3.1 General 
Four call flows are presented in this clause: 
- Inbound roaming target originates a vo
ice call. The CC interception is required. 
- A voice call is terminated to an inbound roaming target. The CC interception is required. 
- An interception is activated while an inbound roaming user is active on a call. 

- An inbound roaming user originates a voi
ce call. The CC interception is not required. 
In all the call flows, the target identity is the SIP URL or TEL URL. All the call flows assume that the SIP messages 
and the media are not encrypted at S-GW/BBIFF (one of the 
requirements for performing the lawful interception in the 
VPLMN for S8HR).

J.3.2 Originating call 
Figure J.5 below illustrates a call flow where an inbound roaming target originates a voice call. In the flow, Party_A 
(target) calls Party_B. The flow shows that Party_B is also an IMS user (SIP messages are shown), however, Party_B 
can also be a non-IMS user served by CS domain. 
 Figure J.5: Call Origination from an inbound roaming target with S8HR 
The S-GW/BBIFF delivers the IMS signalling packets to the 
LMISF. The LMISF examines the SIP message to verify 
whether the SIP headers pointing to the calling party (e.g. P-preferred-Identity, From) is a target. In this illustration, that
 is the case, and therefore, the LMISF forwards the IRI me
ssage containing the SIP INVITE to the DF2 with correlation 
number D1. The DF2 forwards the IRI to the LEMF. 
Since CC interception is required, the LMISF notifies S-
GW/BBIFF with the IMS Signalling Bearer information 
associated with the intercepted IMS session. Once the dedicate
d EPS Bearer to be used as the Media Bearer linked to 
the EPS Bearer ID of the IMS Signalling Bearer is created, S-GW/BBIFF delivers the media packets flowing through 
the GTP tunnel used for that Media Bearer to the LMISF. The LMISF delivers the media packets as the CC along with 

the correlation number D1 to the DF3. The DF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF. 
The LMISF delivers the subsequent SIP messages (in the call flow: 180 Ringing, 200 OK and ACK) received from the 
S-GW/BBIFF as IRI to the DF2 which in turn the deliver the same to the LEMF. 
J.3.3 Terminating call 
Figure J.6 below illustrates a call flow where an inbound roaming target receives a voice call. In the flow, Party_A calls 

Party_B (target). The flow shows that Party_A is also an IMS user (SIP messages are shown), however, Party_A can 

also be a non-IMS user served by CS domain.

 Figure J.6: Call Termination to an inbound roaming target with S8HR 
The S-GW/BBIFF delivers the IMS signalling packets to the 
LMISF. The LMISF examines the SIP message to verify 
whether the SIP headers pointing to the called party (e.g. Request URI, P-Called-Party-Id, To) is a target. In this 
illustration, that is the case, and therefore, the LMISF forwards the IRI message containing the SIP INVITE to the DF2 

with correlation number D1. The DF2 forwards the IRI to the LEMF. 
Since CC interception is required, the LMISF notifies S-
GW/BBIFF with the IMS Signalling Bearer information 
associated with the intercepted IMS session. 

Once the EPS Bearer to be used as the Media Bearer linked 
to the EPS Bearer ID of the IMS Signalling Bearer is 
created, S-GW/BBIFF delivers the media packets flowing through the GTP tunnel used for that Media Bearer to the 
LMISF. The LMISF delivers the media packets as the CC al
ong with the correlation number D1 to the DF3. The DF3

The LMISF delivers the subsequent SIP messages (in the call flow: 180 Ringing, 200 OK and ACK) received from the

J.3.4 Mid-Call Interception 
Figure J.7 below illustrates a call flow where a lawful inter
ception is activated while an inbound roaming user is active 
on a voice call. In the flow, Party_A (target) calls Party_B. The flow shows that Party_B is also an IMS user (SIP 

messages are shown), however, Party_B can also be a non-IMS user served by CS domain.

 Figure J.7: Mid Call Interception 
The S-GW/BBIFF delivers the IMS signalling packets to the 
LMISF. The LMISF examines the SIP message to verify 
whether the SIP headers pointing to the calling party (e.g. P-preferred-Identity, From) is a target. In this illustration, that
 is not the case, and therefore, the LMISF does not generate
 any IRI messages. However, the LMISF stores this SIP 
message and the subsequent SIP messages. The LMISF also maintains the IMS call state for the inbound roaming user. 
In this illustration, a lawful interception is activated on the inbound roaming user right after the called party (Party_B) 
answers the call, but before the Party_A (target) has a chance to send the ACK message. Since the SDP offer and SDP 
answer are already completed, the LMISF generates the 
Start Interception for established IMS session
 with the 
Correlation Number D1 to the DF2 over X2 reference point
. The DF2 forwards the same to the LEMF over the HI2 
reference point. 
NOTE: This flow assumes that there was no other lawful intercepts active on the target. 

Since the just activated lawful interception requires CC 
interception, the LMISF notifies S-GW/BBIFF with the IMS 
Signalling Bearer information associated with the IMS 
session on which the lawful interception is activated. 
The S-GW/BBIFF delivers the media packets from the GTP tunn
el used for the Media Bearer linked to the EPS Bearer 
ID of the IMS Signalling Bearer to the LMISF. The LMISF delivers the media packets as the CC along with the 
correlation number D1 to the DF3. The DF3 deliver
s the CC to the LEMF over HI3 reference point. 
The LMISF delivers the subsequent SIP messages (in the call flow: ACK) received from the S-GW/BBIFF as IRI to the

Figure J.8 below illustrates a call flow where an inbound roaming target originates a voice call. The lawful interception

 Figure J.8: Call Origination from an inbound roaming target with S8HR; CC is not required 
The S-GW/BBIFF delivers the IMS signalling packets to the 
LMISF. The LMISF examines the SIP message to verify 
whether the SIP headers pointing to the calling party (e.g. P-preferred-Identity, From) is a target. In this illustration, that
 is the case, and therefore, the LMISF forwards the IRI me
ssage containing the SIP INVITE to the DF2 with correlation 
number D1. The DF2 forwards the IRI to the LEMF. 
Since CC interception is not required, the LMISF does not 
notify the S-GW/BBIFF with the IMS Signalling Bearer 
information associated with the intercepted IMS session. 

S-GW/BBIFF does not deliver the media packets flowing through the GTP tunnel of Media Bearer to the LMISF. As a 
matter of fact, the S-GW/BBIFF does not know that the call involves a target. 
The LMISF delivers the subsequent SIP messages (in the call flow: 180 Ringing, 200 OK and ACK) received from the 
S-GW/BBIFF as IRI to the DF2 which in turn the deliver the same to the LEMF. 
J.3.6 S-GW Relocation 
Figure J.9 below illustrates a call flow where a a S-GW relocation occurs while an inbound roaming user is active on a 

voice call. In the flow, Party_A (target) calls Party_B. The 
flow shows that Party_B is also an IMS user (SIP messages 
are shown), however, Party_B can also be a non-IMS user served by CS domain.

 Figure J.9: S8HR LI with S-GW Relocation 
The old S-GW/BBIFF delivers the IMS signalling packets to the LMISF. The LMISF examines the SIP message to 
verify whether the SIP headers pointing to the calling party 
(e.g. P-preferred-Identity, From) is a target. In this 
illustration, that is the case, and therefore, the LMISF forwards the IRI message containing the SIP INVITE to the DF2 
with correlation number D1. The DF2 forwards the IRI to the LEMF. 
Since CC interception is required, the LMISF notifies old S-GW/BBIFF with the IMS Signalling Bearer information 
associated with the intercepted IMS session.  
Once the dedicated EPS Bearer to be used as the Media B
earer linked to the EPS Bearer ID of the IMS Signalling 
Bearer is created, old S-GW/BBIFF delivers the media packets flowing through the GTP t
unnel used for that Media 
Bearer to the LMISF. The LMISF deliver
s the media packets as the CC along with the correlation number D1 to the 
DF3. The DF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF. 

The LMISF delivers the subsequent SIP messages (in the call flow: 180 Ringing, 200 OK) received from the old S-
GW/BBIFF as IRI to the DF2 which in turn the deliver the same to the LEMF. 
In this illustration, a S-GW relocation happens right after the called party (Party_B) answers the call, but before the 
Party_A (target) has a chance to send the ACK message. 
 When the IMS Signalling Bearer is created, the new S-
GW/BBIFF notifies the LMISF along with the IMSI value with
 an indication that a S-GW relocation has occurred. The 
  ETSI ETSI TS 133 107 V14.2.0 (2017
-07)3333GPP TS 33.107 version 14.2.0 Release 14
LMISF examines to see whether the IMS Signalling Bearer 
is associated with an intercepted IMS session. In this 
illustration since the CCinterception is required, the LMISF notifies the S-GW/BBIFF with the IMS Signalling Bearer 
information associated with the intercepted IMS session. 
Once the dedicated EPS Bearer to be used as the Media B
earer linked to the EPS Bearer ID of the IMS Signalling 
Bearer is created, new S-GW/BBIFF deliv
ers the media packets flowing through the GTP tunnel used for that Media 
Bearer to the LMISF. The LMISF deliver
s the media packets as the CC along with the correlation number D1 to the 
DF3. The DF3 delivers the CC to the LEMF. 

The LMISF delivers the subsequent SIP messages (in the call flow: ACK) received from the new S-GW/BBIFF as IRI 
to the DF2 which in turn the deliver the same to the LEMF. 
J.4 Correlation of CC and IRI 
A target is identified using SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI. Not all SIP messages carry these identities. The LMISF by 

maintaining the IMS call state is able to determine the subsequent SIP messages that correspond to the same target. 
When a target is involved in multiple IMS sessions, the LM
ISF will have the logic to associate and correlate the SIP 
messages that are related to an IMS session. For example, the SIP messages that have the same Call Identity value can 
be treated as the SIP messages of a particular IMS session 
and hence, when reported to the LEMF (via DF2) can have 
the same Correlation Number. 
LMISF will also examine the SIP messages that carry the SDP offer and SDP answer to determine the media 
information related to an IMS session. 
When an IMS session is established, the media information is exchanged between the two end points of the media 
stream (e.g. target's UE and IMS-AGW in HPLMN) through the SDP offer and answer process. The combination of IP 

address of the end point (e.g. UE and IMS AGW) and UDP port numbers used to transport the RTP and RTCP are part 

of this SDP offer and answer along with other things like
 Codec information. The media packets (i.e. RTP streams) 
exchanged between the two end points of the media use those IP addresses and the port numbers (assigned for RTP). 
One method that can be used to establish the correlation is
 to use the IP addresses and the UDP port numbers exchanged 
within the SDP offer and answer process and compare them with the IP addresses and UDP port numbers of the media 
packets to establish an association between the IMS session and the media. 
In other words, the IP address and UDP port numbers associ
ated with a media packet when compared with the IP 
address and UDP port numbers exchanged in the SDP offer and answer, one can determine to which IMS session a 

media packet corresponds to. Once that determination is made
, these parameters may be used to establish a correlation. 
When S-GW/BBIFF is asked to deliver the packets from the 
IMS Signalling Bearers to LMISF, it delivers everything 
above the GTP-U layer. S-GW/BBIFF does not look into the IMS packets above the GTP-U layer. Similarly, when the 

S-GW/BBIFF is asked to deliver the packets from the Media Bearer to the LMISF, it delivers everything above the 

GTP-U layer. It does not look into the Media packets above the GTP-U layer. However, the BBIFF knows that the 

Media Bearer and the IMS Signalling Bearer are related through the GTP protocol concepts defined in TS 29.274 [38]. 
The LMISF will generate a Correlation Number and include that Correlation Number while delivering the SIP messages 
to the DF2. When the media packets are received, LMI
SF will examine the Media packets to determine which IMS 
session, the Media packets are related to. Once determined, 
the LMISF will deliver the Media packets to the DF3 along 

with the Correlation Number previously
 stored against the IMS session.
