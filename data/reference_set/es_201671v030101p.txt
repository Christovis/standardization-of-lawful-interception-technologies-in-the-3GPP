Foreword 
This ETSI Standard (ES) has been produced by ETSI Technical Committee Lawful Interception (LI). 
Introduction 
References within the main body of the present document are made if applicable to the 3GPP specification number with 

in square brackets the reference number as listed in clause 2. In clause 2 "References" the corresponding ETSI 
specification number is indicated with a reference to the 3GPP specification number. 3GPP specifications are available 
faster than the equivalent ETSI specifications. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 9  1 Scope The present document is step 3 of a three-step approach to describe a generic Handover Interface (HI) for the provision 
of lawful interception from a Network Operator, an Access Provider or a Service Provider (NWO/AP/SvP) to the 

Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). The provision of lawful interception is a requirement of national law, which is 

usually mandatory for the operation of any telecommunication service. 
Step 1 contains the requirements for lawful interception from a users (LEAs) point of view and is published in 
TS 101 331 [1]. 
Step 2 describes the derived network functions and the general architecture (or functional model) and is published in 
ES 201 158 [2]. 
The present document specifies: 
 the
 generic flow of information
 as well as the procedures and information elements, which are applicable to 
any future telecommunication network or service; 
 the network/service specific protocols relating to the provision of lawful interception at the Handover Interface 
(HI), for the following networks/services: 
- switched circuit; and 
- packet data. 
The technologies covered in the present document are: GSM, TETRA, GPRS, ISDN, PSTN, fixed NGN (including 
PSTN/ISDN emulation) and fixed IMS PSTN simulation. 
NOTE: As new networks and/or services are developed, the present document will be expanded as the relevant 
standards become available.

4 General requirements 
The present document focuses on the Handover Interface related to the provision of information related to LI between a 

network operator, access provider and/or service provider and a Law Enforcement Agency (LEA). 
4.1 Basic principles for the Handover Interface 
The network requirements mentioned in the present document are derived, in part, from the requirements defined in 

ES 201 158 [2]. 
Lawful interception requires functions to be provided in some, or all of, the switching or routing nodes of a 
telecommunications network. 
The specification of the Handover Interface is subdivided into three ports each optimized to the different purposes and 
types of information being exchanged. 
The interface is extensible. 
4.2 Legal requirements 
It shall be possible to select elements from the Handover Interface specification to conform with: 
- national requirements; 

- national law; 
- any law applicable to a specific LEA. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 19 As a consequence, the present document shall define, in addition to mandatory requirements, which are always 
applicable, supplementary options, in order to take into account the various influences listed above. See also 

TS 101 331 [1] and ETR 330 [3]. 
4.3 Functional requirements 
A lawful authorization shall describe the kind of information (Intercept Related Information (IRI) or both IRI and 

Content of Communication (CC)) that is required by this LEA, the interception subject, the start and stop time of LI, 

and the addresses of the LEAs for CC and/or IRI and further information. 
A single interception subject may be the subject to interception by different LEAs. It shall be possible strictly to 
separate these interception measures. 
If two targets are communicating with each other, each target is dealt with separately. 
5 Overview of Handover Interface 
The generic Handover Interface adopts a three-port structure such that administrative information (HI1), Intercept 
Related Information (HI2) and the Content of Communication (HI3) are logically separated. 
Figure 1 shows a block diagram with the relevant entities for Lawful Interception (LI). 

The outer circle represents the NWO/AP/SvP's domain with respect to lawful interception. It contains the network 
internal functions, the Internal Network Interface (INI), the administration function and the mediation functions for IRI 
and CC. The inner circle contains the internal functions of the network (e.g. switching, routing, and handling of the 

communication process). Within the network internal function the results of interception (IRI, CC) are generated in the 

IIF. 
The Internal Interception Functions (IIF) provide the Content of Communication (CC) and the Intercept Related 
Information (IRI), respectively, at the Internal Network Interface INI. For both kinds of information, mediation 
functions may be used, which provide the final representation of the standardized Handover Interfaces at the 
NWO/AP/SvP's domain boundary. 
Within the NWO/AP/SvP's administration centre, the LI related tasks, as received via interface HI1, are translated into 
man machine commands for the NWO/AP/SvP's equipment. 
Depending on the type of network, there might be a need to standardize also some or all of the Internal Network 
Interfaces (INI). Such standards are not in the scope of the present document. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 20  NOTE 1: Figure 1 shows only a reference configuration, with a logical representation of the entities involved in 
lawful interception and does not mandate separate physical entities. 
NOTE 2: The mediation functions may be transparent. 
 Figure 1: Functional block diagram showing Handover Interface HI 
5.1 Handover Interface port 1 (HI1) 
The Handover Interface port 1 shall transport various kinds of administrative information from/to the LEA and the 
organization at the NWO/AP/SvP, which is responsible for LI matters. This interface may be manual or electronic. 
The HI1 interface may be crossing borders between countries. This possibility is subject to corresponding international 
laws or agreements. 
A complete separation is required between the administrative part (HI1) and the technical part (INI) of the interface.  
No direct access to the switching function shall be given to the LEMF. Activation, deactivation or modification of an 
interception in the switching function shall only be possible by the NWO/AP/SvP. 
As an option, in direction to the LEA, some HI1 related information (e.g. fault reporting) may be delivered directly 
using the HI2 mechanism. As an additional option, in direction to the LEA, some HI1 related information may be 

delivered directly, for example, as part of a lawful authorization procedure. 
Further description of HI1 is given in clause 7. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 21 5.1.1 Manual interface 
If the HI1 is designed as a manual interface, it will normally consist of paper documents. The request for lawful 
interception may be sent via letter or via fax to the administration centre of the NWO/AP/SvP. The personnel of the 
administration centre will take the request and activate it in the network element (activation of interception). After the 

interception specified in the lawful authorization is activated, the LEA will be informed, see clause 7. From this point in 

time on, the LEA shall be prepared to receive Intercept Related Information (IRI) via HI2 and Content of 

Communication (CC) via HI3. 
5.1.2 Electronic interface 
An alternative solution may be the electronic transmission of the request for lawful interception. 
The information content shall be such that the authorized personnel of the NWO/AP/SvP is able to map it to the 
information which is required to activate the interception with a minimum of manual translation. This principle reduces 
the probability of errors. 
5.2 Handover Interface port 2 (HI2) 
The Handover Interface port 2 shall transport the IRI from the NWO/AP/SvP's IIF to the LEMF. 
The delivery shall be performed via data communication methods which are suitable for the network infrastructure and 
for the kind and volume of data to be transmitted. 
The delivery can in principle be made via different types of lower communication layers, which should be standard or 
widely used data communication protocols. 
The individual IRI parameters shall be coded using ASN.1 and the Basic Encoding Rules (BER). The format of the 
parameter's information content shall be based on existing telecommunication standards, where possible. 
The individual IRI parameters have to be sent to the LEMF at least once (if available). 

The IRI records are transmitted individually, or as an option, IRI records can be aggregated for delivery to the same 
LEA (i.e. in a single delivery interaction). As there are time constraints associated with the delivery of IRI, the use of 

this optional feature is subject to national or regional requirements. As a general principle, IRI records shall be sent 
immediately and shall not be held in the MF/DF in order to use the IRI record aggregation option. 
The IRI records shall contain information available from normal network or service operating procedures. In addition 
the IRI records shall include information for identification and control purposes as specifically required by the HI2 port. 
The IIF is not required to make any attempt to request explicitly extra information which has not already been supplied 
by a signalling system. 
5.3 Handover Interface port 3 (HI3) 
The appropriate form of HI3 depends upon the technology being intercepted, see clause 9. 
6 Specific identifiers for LI 
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception uniquely and to correlate between the data, which 
is conveyed over the different Handover Interfaces (HI1, HI2 and HI3). The identifiers, which apply to all 
communication technologies, are defined in the clauses below. Additional technology specific identifiers are defined in 

related annexes. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 22 6.1 Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID) 
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized NWO/AP/SvP operator shall assign a special 
Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the NWO/AP/SvP. It is used within 
parameters of all HI interface ports. 
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it easier to keep the knowledge about a specific 
interception target limited within the authorized NWO/AP/SvP operators and the handling agents at the LEA. 
The Lawful Interception IDentifier LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records. It shall be 
used within any information exchanged at the Handover Interfaces HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation 

purposes. 
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters (or digit string for subaddress option, see annex E). It might 
for example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference number, and the date, when the lawful 

authorization was issued. 
The authorized NWO/AP/SvP shall either enter a unique LIID for each target identity of the interception subject or as a 
national option a single LIID for multiple target identities all pertaining to the same interception subject. 
EXAMPLE: The interception subject has an ISDN access with three MSNs. The NWO/AP/SvP enters for each 
MSN an own LIID, or optionally enters one LIID for all three MSNs. 
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be unique LIIDs assigned, relating to each LEA. 
6.2 Communication IDentifier (CID) 
NOTE 1: Was called "Call Identifier" in V1.1.1 of ES 201 671. It is renamed because of new technologies. 
For each activity relating to a target identity a CID is generated by the relevant network element. The CID consists of 
the following two identifiers: 
- Network IDentifier (NID); 

- Communication Identity Number (CIN) - optional. 
NOTE 2: For all non CC related records like SMS, SCI etc. no correlation to a CC could be made. 
The CID distinguishes between the different activities of the target identity. It is also used for correlation between IRI 
records and CC connections. It is used at the interface ports HI2 and HI3. 
The Communication IDentifier is specified in the clauses below. For ASN.1 coding details, see annex D. 
6.2.1 Network IDentifier (NID) 
The Network IDentifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be internationally unique. It consists of one or both 
of the following two identifiers: 
1) NWO/AP/SvP- identifier (mandatory): 
Unique identification of network operator, access provider or service provider. 
2) Network Element IDentifier (NEID) (optional): 
The purpose of the network element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element carrying out 

the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending, etc. 
 A network element identifier may be: 
- an E.164 international node number in the case of circuit switched networks, such as ISDN, PSTN, 
GSM; - an X.25 address; 

- an IP address. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 23 6.2.2 Communication Identity Number (CIN) - optional 
NOTE 1: Was called "Call Identity Number" in V1.1.1 of ES 201 671. It is renamed because of new technologies. 
This parameter is mandatory for IRI in case of reporting events for connection-oriented types of communication 
(e.g. circuit switched calls). 
The Communication Identity Number (CIN) identifies uniquely an intercepted communication session within the 
relevant network element. All the results of interception within a single communications session must have the same 

CIN. If a single interception subject has two or more communications sessions through the same operator, and through 

the same network element then the CIN for each session shall be different. 
NOTE 2: If two or more target identities, related either to an unique interception subject or to different interception 
subjects, are involved in the same communication the same CIN value may be assigned by the relevant 

network element to the communication sessions of the different target identities. 
7 HI1: Interface port for administrative information 
The interface HI1 is typically bi-directional. It is used to hand over the requests for lawful interception to the 

NWO/AP/SvP, such as orders for activation, deactivation and modification, and the corresponding notifications, and 
send other information to the LEA. 
There shall be no direct control over the NWO/AP/SvP's equipment by the LEA/LEMF. 
7.1 Information for the activation of lawful interception 
The HI1 interface may be realized as manual or electronic processing, see clause 5.1. 

If the LEA requests lawful interception, the NWO/AP/SvP needs a minimum set of information to activate lawful 
interception in the network. 
The LEA shall provide the following information, for activation of LI: 
1) Identification of the interception subject: target identity. 

2) The agreed Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID). 
3) Start and end (or duration) of the interception. 
4) Further specification of type of interception, i.e. kind of information to be provided (IRI or both IRI and CC). 

5) HI2 destination address of the LEMF, to which the IRI-Records shall be sent (if applicable). 

6) HI3 destination address of the LEMF, to which the Content of Communication (CC) shall be sent  
(if applicable). 
7) Other network dependent parameters (e.g. location information, delivery mechanisms used for HI2 and HI3). 
8) A reference for authorization of the interception. 
9) Technical contact for issues relating to set-up and execution of the interception (e.g. solution of problems with 
communication links to the LEMF). 
10) Other information as required. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 24 7.2 LI notifications towards the LEMF 
LI management notifications to the LEMF shall be sent in the following cases: 
1) After the activation of lawful interception. 
2) After the deactivation of lawful interception. 
3) After modification of an active lawful interception. 

4) In case of certain exceptional situations. 
For the definition of the information content of these LI management notifications, see clause D.4. 
8 HI2: Interface port for Intercept Related Information 
The HI2 interface port shall be used to transport all Intercept Related Information (IRI), i.e. the information or data 
associated with the communication services of the target identity apparent to the network. It includes signalling 
information used to establish the telecommunication service and to control its progress, timestamps, and, if available, 

further information such as supplementary service information or location information. Only information which is part 

of standard network signalling procedures shall be used within communication related IRI, see also clause 5.2; e.g. if 

information of the other party is not available, it need not be requested from the origin, by extra procedures, especially 

when such procedures are not provided by the used network protocols. 
Sending of the Intercept Related Information (IRI) to the LEMF shall in general take place as soon as possible, after the 
relevant information is available. 
In exceptional cases (e.g. data link failure), the Intercept Related Information (IRI) may be buffered for later 
transmission for a specified period of time. 
Within this clause only definitions are made which apply in general for all network technologies. Additional technology 
specific HI2 definitions are specified in related annexes (e.g. for circuit switched communication technologies, 
see clause A.3). 
8.1 Data transmission protocols 
The protocol used by the "LI application" for the encoding and the sending of data between the MF and the LEMF is 

based on already standardized data transmission protocols like ROSE or FTP, see annex C. 
The specified data communication methods provide a general means of data communication between the LEA and the 
NWO/AP/SvP's mediation function. They are used for the delivery of: 
 HI1 type of information (notifications and alarms); 
 HI2 type of information (IRI records); 
 HI3 data type of information in certain circumstances (UUS, SMS, etc.). 
The present document specifies the use of the two possible methods for delivery: ROSE or FTP on the application layer 
and the BER on the presentation layer. The lower layers for data communication may be chosen in agreement with the 

NWO/AP/SvP and the LEA. 
The delivery to the LEMF should use the Internet protocol stack.
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 25 8.1.1 Application for IRI (HI2 information) 
As defined in clause 5.2, the Handover Interface port 2 shall transport the Intercept Related Information (IRI) from the 
NWO/AP/SvP's MF to the LEMF. 
The individual IRI parameters shall be coded using ASN.1 and the Basic Encoding Rules (BER). Where possible, the 
format of the information content shall be taken over from existing telecommunication standards, which are used for 

these parameters with the network already (e.g. the ISDN user part, DSS1, MAP and IP). Within the ASN.1 coding for 

IRI, such standard parameters are typically defined as octet strings. 
8.2 Types of IRI records 
Intercept related information shall be conveyed to the LEMF in messages, or IRI data records, respectively.  

Four types of IRI records are defined: 
1) IRI-BEGIN record at the first event of a communication attempt, opening the IRI transaction; 
2) IRI-END record at the end of a communication or communication attempt, closing the IRI transaction; 

3) IRI-CONTINUE record at any time during a communication or communication attempt within the IRI 
transaction; 
4) IRI-REPORT record used in general for non-communication related events. 
For information related to an existing communication case, the record types 1 to 3 shall be used. They form an IRI 
transaction for each communication case or communication attempt, which corresponds directly to the communication 
phase (set-up, active or release). 
Record type 4 is used for non-communication related subscriber action, like Subscriber Controlled Input (SCI) for 
service activation. For simple cases, it can also be applicable for reporting unsuccessful communication attempts. 
The record type is an explicit part of the record. The 4 record types are defined independently of target communication 
events. The actual indication of one or several communication events, which caused the generation of an IRI record, is 
part of further parameters within the record's information content. Consequently, the record types of the IRI transactions 
are not related to specific messages of the signalling protocols of a communication case, and are therefore independent 

of future enhancements of the intercepted services, of network specific features, etc. Any transport level information 

(i.e. higher-level services) on the target communication-state or other target communication related information is 

contained within the information content of the IRI records. 
9 HI3: Interface port for Content of Communication 
The port HI3 shall transport the Content of the Communication (CC) of the intercepted telecommunication service to 
the LEMF. The Content of Communication (CC) shall be presented as a transparent en-clair copy of the information 
flow during an established, frequently bi-directional, communication of the interception subject. 
As the appropriate form of HI3 depends upon the service being intercepted, HI3 is described in relevant annexes. 

The HI2 and HI3 are logically different interfaces, even though in some installations the HI2 and HI3 packet streams 
might also be delivered via a common transmission path from a MF to a LEMF. It is possible to correlate HI2 and HI3 
packet streams by having common (referencing) data fields embedded in the IRI and the CC packet streams. This may 
be possible e.g. for packet switched, but not for analogue circuit switched networks. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 26 10 Performance and quality 
10.1 Timing 
As a general principle, within a telecommunication system, Intercept Related Information (IRI), if buffered, should be 
buffered for as short a time as possible. 
NOTE: If the transmission of Intercept Related Information fails, it may be buffered or lost. 
10.2 Quality 
The Quality of Service (QoS) associated with the result of interception should be (at least) equal to the 
Quality of Service (QoS) of the original Content of Communication (CC). 
11 Security aspects 
This clause will give an informative overview of the security properties and mechanisms that can be used to meet 
possible security requirements for the transportation of Lawful Intercepted data. 
11.1 Security properties 
A secure communication channel has the following properties: 
- confidentiality; 

- integrity; 

- authentication; 
- availability. 
Confidentiality
 means that it is impossible to interpret the data by eavesdropping on the communication link. 
Integrity
 means that any alteration or mutilation of the transported data is immediately detected. 
Authentication
 means that the communicating parties have verified and confirmed each others' identities. 
Availability
 means that the communicating parties have made agreements about up- and downtimes of the systems. In 
case of irregularities, alarm messages should be sent through another communication channel. Because of the nature of 
the transported data, confidentiality can be an issue. Lawful Intercepted data can also be confidential or secret by law 
and appropriate measures need to be taken to prevent eavesdropping by unauthorized third parties. 
Integrity can be an issue when Lawful Intercepted data is used as evidence in a criminal investigation. It must be 
provable that the data is unaltered and an exact representation of the intercepted communication. 
In the process of Lawful Interception (LI) it is very important to know that the LEMF is receiving the data from a real 
MF and the MF needs to be sure that it is sending its data to a real LEMF. If this verification of identity does not take 
place, Lawful Intercepted data might end up in the wrong place or the LEMF is processing data that is originating from 
an unauthorized source. 
The process of Lawful Interception (LI) takes place during well-defined periods of time. In case of any irregularities, 
appropriate actions need to be taken. Irregularities can be a sign of a breach of security, loss of data or detection of 

interception. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 27 11.2 Security mechanisms 
This clause will give an overview of possible mechanisms to achieve the properties as described above. Technical 
details are to be decided during the process of implementation. 
Confidentiality can be achieved by using encryption. A common technique is to use a symmetric encryption algorithm. 
A symmetric algorithm is an algorithm where both communicating parties use the same key for encryption and 

decryption. This key must be exchanged in a secure way. 
Integrity can be achieved using hashing algorithms. These algorithms generate a unique fingerprint of the transported 
data. When the transported data is altered, the fingerprint does not match anymore and appropriate actions can be 

undertaken (like retransmission of data). 
Authentication can be achieved using cryptographic techniques. A common technique is to use asymmetric encryption. 
In this technique, both parties have two keys: A public key and a private key. Data encrypted with one key can only be 

deciphered with the other. If party X encrypts something using the public key of party Y then party Y is the only one 

able to decrypt this data using his private key. If party X encrypts something using his private key then this data can 

only be deciphered using his public key. By combining these properties, both parties can make sure that they are 
communicating with the right party. 
12 Quantitative aspects 
See ES 201 158 [2]. The number of targets based on a percentage of subscribers should be provided at a national level 
together with an indication as to the expected usage. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 28 Annex A (normative): 
Circuit switched network handover 
This annex is applicable to 64 kbit/s based circuit switched networks. 
A.1 Specific identifiers for LI 
In this clause, additional identifiers, which are needed in circuit switched networks are described here. See clause 6. 
A communication is a call in a circuit switched network. 
A.1.1 CC Link IDentifier (CCLID) 
This identifier is only used at the interface ports HI2 and HI3 in case of the reuse of CC links (option B, 
see clause A.5.4.2). 
For each CC link, which is set up by the mediation function towards the LEMF, a CC Link IDentifier (CCLID) is 
transmitted in the HI2 records and HI3 set-up message in addition to CIN and NID. For the correct correlation of 

multiparty calls this identity number indicates in the IRI records of each multiparty call, which CC link is used for the 

transmission of the CC. 
The CCLID may use the same format as the CIN; in this case, it need not be transmitted explicitly during set up of the 
CC links, as part of HI3. The CIN may also implicitly represent the CCLID. 
A.1.2 Circuit switched LI correlation between CC and IRI 
To assure correlation between the independently transmitted Content of Communication (CC) and Intercept Related 

Information (IRI) of an intercepted call the following parameters are used: 
- Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID), see clause 6.1; 

- Communication IDentifier (CID), see clause 6.2; 

- CC Link IDentifier (CCLID), see clause A.1.1. 
These parameters are transferred from the MF to the LEMF in: 
- HI2, see clause A.3.2.1; 
- HI3, see clause A.4.2. 
A.1.3 Usage of Identifiers 
The identifiers are exchanged between the mediation function and the LEMF via the interfaces HI1, HI2 and HI3. There 
exist several interface options for the exchange of information. Tables A.1.1 and A.1.2 define the usage of numbers and 
identifiers depending on these options.

A.3.1 Definition of Intercept Related Information (IRI) 
Intercept Related Information (IRI) will in principle be available in the following phases of a call (successful or not): 
1) At call initiation when the target identity becomes active, at which time call destination information may or 
may not be available (set up phase of a call, target may be the originating or terminating party, or be involved 
indirectly by a supplementary service). 
2) At the end of a call, when the target identity becomes inactive (release phase of call). 

3) At certain times between the above phases, when relevant information becomes available (active phase of 
call). 
In addition, information on non-call related actions of a target constitutes IRI and is sent via HI2, e.g. information on 
Subscriber Controlled Input (SCI). 
The Intercept Related Information (IRI) may be subdivided into the following categories: 
1) Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information). 

2) Basic call information, for standard calls between two parties. 

3) Information related to supplementary services, which have been invoked during a call. 
4) Information on non-call related target actions. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 30 A.3.2 Structure of IRI records 
Each IRI-record contains several parameters. In the clauses below, the usage of these parameters is explained in more 
detail. 
Mandatory parameters are indicated as HI2 control information. Optional parameters are provided depending on the 
availability at the MF. For the internal structure of the IRI records, the ASN.1 description, with the application of the 

Basic Encoding Rules (BER) is used. This ASN.1 specification is enclosed in annex D. 
A.3.2.1 Control information for HI2 
The main purpose of this information is the unique identification of records related to a target identity, including their 

unique mapping to the links carrying the Content of Communication (CC). In general, parameters of this category are 

mandatory, i.e. they have to be provided in any record. 
The following items are identified (in brackets: ASN.1 name and reference to the ASN.1 definition or clause D.5): 
1) Record type (
IRIContent
, see clause D.5) 
IRI-BEGIN, IRI-CONTINUE, IRI-END, IRI-REPORT-record types. 
2) Version indication (
iRIversion
, see clause D.5) 
Identification of the particular version of the HI2 interface specification. 
3) Communication IDentifier (
CommunicationIdentifier,
 see clauses 6.2 and D.5). 
4) Lawful Interception IDentifier (
LawfulInterceptionIdentifier,
 see clauses 6.1 and D.5). 
5) Date and time (
TimeStamp
, see clause D.5) 
Date and time of record trigger condition.  

The parameter shall have the capability to indicate whether the time information is given as Local time without 

time zone, or as UTC. Normally, the NWO/AP/SvP shall define these options. 
6) CC Link IDentifier (
CC-Link-Identifier
, see clause A.1.2 for definition and clause D.5 for ASN.1 definition). 
Table A.3.1 summarizes the items of HI2 control information. It is mandatory information, except the CID - it may be 
omitted for non-call related IRI records - and the CCLID. Their format and coding definition is LI specific, i.e. not 

based on other signalling standards.

 A.3.2.2 Basic call information 
This clause defines parameters within IRI records for basic calls, i.e. calls, for which during their progress no 
supplementary services have been invoked. In general, the parameters are related to either the originating or terminating 
party of a call; consequently, ASN.1 containers are defined for the originating/terminating types of parties, which allow 
including the relevant, party-related information. The structure of these containers and the representation of individual 

items are defined in clause D.5. 
NOTE: A third type of party information is defined for the forwarded-to-party (see clause A.3.2.3 on calls with 
supplementary services being invoked). 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 31 The items below are to be included, when they become available for the first time during a call in progress. If the same 
item appears identically several times during a call, it needs only to be transmitted once, e.g. in an IRI-BEGIN record. 

The ASN.1 name of the respective parameters, as defined in clause D.5, is indicated in brackets: 
1) Direction of call (
intercepted-Call-Direct
) Indication, whether the target identity is originating or terminating Party. 
2) Address of originating and terminating parties (
CallingPartyNumber 
or CalledPartyNumber
) If e.g. in case of call originated by the target at transmission of the IRI-BEGIN record only a partial 
terminating address is available, it shall be transmitted, the complete address shall follow, when available. 
3) Basic Service, LLC (
Services-Information
)  Parameters as received from signalling protocol (e.g. BC, HLC, TMR, LLC). 
4) Cause (
ISUP-parameters
 or DSS1-parameters-codeset-0
) Reason for release of intercepted call. Cause value as received from signalling protocol. It is transmitted with 
the ASN.1 container of the party, which initiated the release; in case of a network-initiated release, it may be 

either one. 
5) Additional network parameters 
E.g. location information (
Location
). Parameters defined within tables A.3.2 and A.3.3 shall be used for existing services, in the given ETSI format. National 
extensions may be possible using the ASN.1 parameter 
National-Parameters
. A.3.2.3 Information on Supplementary Services, related to a call in progress 
The general principle is to transmit service related information within IRI records, when the corresponding 
event/information, which needs to be conveyed to the LEMF, is received from the signalling protocol. Where possible, 

the coding of the related information shall use the same formats as defined by standard signalling protocols. 
The selection, which types of events or information elements are relevant for transmission to the LEAs is conforming to 
the requirements defined in TS 101 331 [1] and ES 201 158 [2]. 
A dedicated ASN.1 parameter is defined for supplementary services related to forwarding or re-routing calls 
(forwarded-to-Party
 information), due to the major relevance of these kinds of services with respect to LI. For the 
various cases of forwarded calls, the information related to forwarding is included in the 

originatingParty
/terminatingParty
/forwarded-to-Party
 information: 
1) If a call to the target has been previously forwarded, available parameters relating to the redirecting party(ies) 
are encapsulated within the 
originatingPartyInformation
 parameter. 
2) If the call is forwarded at the target's access (conditional or unconditional forwarding towards the forwarded-
to-party), the parameters which are related to the redirecting party (target) are encapsulated within the 
terminatingPartyInformation
 parameter. 
3) All parameters related to the forwarded-to-party or beyond the forwarded-to-party are encapsulated within the 
forwarded-to-Party
 ASN.1 coded parameter. In addition, this parameter includes the 
supplementary-Services-
Information
, containing the forwarded-to address, and the redirection information parameter, with the reason 
of the call forwarding, the number of redirection, etc.). 
For the detailed specification of supplementary services related procedures see clause A.5. 

Parameters defined within tables A.3.2 and A.3.3 shall be used for existing services, in the given ETSI format. National 
extensions may be possible using the ASN.1 parameter National-Parameters. 
A.3.2.4 Information on non-call related Supplementary Services 
The general principle is to transmit non-call related service information as received from the signalling protocol. 
A typical user action to be reported is Subscriber Controlled Input (SCI). 

For the detailed specification of the related procedures see clause A.5. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 32 A.3.3 Selection of parameters for IRI records 
Relevant information on a call is taken from the call handling process, using wherever possible the coding 
specifications of the standardized ISDN protocols, or other standard network protocols. The protocol-defined 
information content is copied transparently into the information elements of the IRI records. This principle enables to 
reuse of internationally agreed standardization results; it allows reuse of existing functions within the NWO/AP/SvP 

equipment and in the
 terminal area (LEMF). 
Consequently, the present document needs for a large number of IRI-relevant items only to refer to other, existing 
standards, instead of including separate definitions in its scope. By this principle, also consistency issues and 

dependencies on the ongoing enhancements of the various protocols are minimized. 
The relevant parameters are listed in tables A.3.2 and A.3.3. 
For other signalling systems, which are not included in table A.3.2, the parameters shall be interpreted on a functional 
level, for defining their applicability in an IRI record; e.g. in case of a local call between analogue users, the 
called 
party number
 may only exist in an internal format of the switching system. Within the IRI records, such parameters 
shall also use the standardized coding. Existing interworking specifications, like EN 300 097-1 [14] shall be used for 
the conversion to the standard format. If the signalling system provides less information than defined by the standards in 
table A.3.2, spare or default values may be used instead. 
This method avoids the need to analyse for all situations, especially in the area of supplementary services, each detail of 
the service procedures, with specification of which parameter shall be sent in which state or situation. Instead, only a 

reference to the applicable standards is made. As soon as a parameter defined in one of the parameter tables appears 

within the target call protocol, it shall be transmitted within an IRI record. 
In addition to parameters taken from the call handling process, further, lawful interception specific parameters are 
needed, like the control information for LI. 
Three types of origins for the specification of HI2 parameters in IRI records can be differentiated: 
1) Parameters for LI control information; they are specific for the LI HI2 interface, and are specified in the 
present document (see table A.3.1). 
2) Parameters used to convey information to the LEMF, which is retrieved from the target's call or service 
signalling protocol information (see table A.3.2). Within the IRI a standardized protocol coding is used. 
The relevant protocol specifications are the ISDN user part, as a generic protocol, used by several types of 
networks, and dedicated network protocols, e.g. DSS1 or GSM standards. For a common implementation in 

different countries and to guarantee the possibility of an interception measure across borders only parameters 

defined in ETSI standards shall be used. 
3) Parameters used to convey information from events relating to the target call, but with no equivalent 
parameters being available in protocol standards. Such parameters shall be specified in the present document 

(see table A.3.3). 
The LI control information is a mandatory part of each IRI record (exception: CID), the information defined in 
table A.3.3 is included in IRI records, if the according parameter or event is detected during processing a call or a target 

identity related action.

NOTE: Format and coding details (see annex D). 
 The general principle is that, if parameters included in table A.3.2 are available, they shall be included in an IRI record, 
and be sent to the LEMF. Parameters of table A.3.3, which are not part of standard protocols, shall be included, when 

the according event or parameter, which needs to be reported to the LEMF, is detected. 
Parameters of table A.3.1 are present in all IRI records, except the Communication Identifier: it may be missing in IRI-
REPORT records; if no target call is related to it. 
The list can be adapted to the requirements and feature specifications of an NWO/AP/SvP, and the laws and regulations 
of a country. That is, tables A.3.2 and A.3.3 may be extended nationally, or by a NWO/AP/SvP. Further in the present 

document, such extensions are referred to as national extensions or national parameters. 
The IIF for IRI parameter generation may be seen as a kind of screening function, which watches the signalling 
information flow related to a target, and copies those information elements, which match with an element type in the 
screening lists, defined by tables A.3.2 and A.3.3. 
The NWO/AP/SvP is not required to filter information out of the IRI. 

An instance of the IIF for IRI generation needs in general not to store the information it has sent, or other information 
on a call, for the purpose to be aware of the status or context of a call. Each IRI parameter is independent from previous 

or future parameters. Exceptions from this general principle can exist, e.g. in order to avoid multiple transmission of the 
same information. In such a case identical parameters do not have to be repeated in succeeding records, unless their 
content or value has changed. 
As it is indicated in table A.3.2, for a given logical parameter different format types may be used, depending on the type 
of network, and the call configuration. If a parameter is specified in the ISDN user part, and also identically in other 

standards, only the ISDN user part is referenced. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 35 A.3.4 Coding of parameters in IRI records 
The parameters shall be included in the IRI records in a structured way. The structure is defined using ASN.1, the 
individual parameters are in terms of the ASN.1 notation octet strings, which are taken over from the applicable 
standards. The ASN.1 detailed coding specification is described in annex D. 
In case of the delivery of the IRI records to a LEA, when network specific extensions are used, the network specific 
parameters are transmitted as defined by the sending network. 
A.3.5 Information content of the IRI record types 
In principle, no restriction is made on which parameters shall or may be present in which IRI record type, except for the 

mandatory parameters, which are needed in all records. However, the logical information flow of calls implies that 

certain parameters will normally not appear in specific records; e.g. a called party number parameter is not included in 

an IRI-END record, because it has already been transmitted earlier. 
A.4 HI3: interface port for Content of Communication 
The port HI3 shall transport the Content of the Communication (CC) of the intercepted telecommunication service to 

the LEMF. The Content of Communication (CC) shall be presented as a transparent en-clair copy of the information 

flow during an established, frequently bi-directional, communication of the interception subject. It may contain voice or 

data. A target call has two directions of transmission associated with it, to the target, and from the target. Two 

communication channels to the LEMF are needed for transmission of the Content of Communication (stereo 

transmission). 
The network does not record or store the Content of Communication (CC). 
A.4.1 Delivery of Content of Communication (CC) 
The transmission media used to support the HI3 port shall be standard ISDN calls, based on 64 kbit/s circuit switched 
bearer connections. The CC links are set up on demand to the LEMF. The LEMF constitutes an ISDN DSS1 user 
function, with an ISDN DSS1 basic or primary rate access. It may be locally connected to the target switching node, or 

it may be located somewhere in the target network or in another network, with or without a transit network in between. 

For network signalling, the standard ISDN user part shall be used. No modifications of the existing ISDN protocols 

shall be required. Any information needed for LI, like to enable correlation with the IRI records of a call, can be 

inserted in the existing messages and parameters, without the need to extend the ETSI standard protocols for the LI 
application. 
For each LI activation, a fixed LEMF address is assigned; this address is, within the present document, not used for any 
identification purposes. Identification and correlation of the CC links is performed by separate, LI specific information, 

see clauses 6 and A.1. 
The functions defined in the ISDN user part standard, Version 1 (ETSI ISUP V1) are required as a minimum within the 
target network and, if applicable, the destination and transit networks, especially for the support of: 
- Correlation of HI3 information to the other HI port's information, using the supplementary service User-to-
User Signalling 1 implicit (UUS1). 
- Access verification of the delivery call (see clause A.4.5). 
The bearer capability used for the CC links is 64 kbit/s unrestricted digital information; this type guarantees that the 
information is passed transparently to the LEMF. No specific HLC parameter value is required. 
The CC communication channel is a one-way connection, from the NWO/AP/SvP's IIF to the LEMF, the opposite 
direction is not switched through in the switching node of the target. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 36 The scenario for delivery of the Content of Communication (CC) is as follows: 
1) At call attempt initiation, for one 64 kbit/s bi-directional target call, two ISDN delivery calls are established 
from the MF to the LEMF. One call offers the Content of Communication (CC) towards the target identity 
(CC R
x call/channel), the other call offers the Content of Communication (CC) from the target identity (CC T
x call/channel). See figure A.4.1. 
2) During the establishment of each of these calls, appropriate checks are made (see clause A.4.5). 

3) The MF passes during call set up, within the signalling protocol elements of the CC link the LIID and the CID 
to the LEMF. The LEMF uses this information to identify the target identity and to correlate between the IRI 
and CC (see clause A.4.2). 
4) At the end of a call attempt, each delivery call associated with that call attempt shall be released by the MF.

A.4.1.1 Delivery of TETRA CC over circuit switched handover networks 
The mechanisms described above apply with the additional constraint that TETRA encoded speech shall be further 
encoded in accordance with the mechanisms defined in TS 100 392-3-6 [73] to fit to a standard 64 kbit/s bearer. 
NOTE: TETRA Switching and Management Infrastructures will in most cases carry TETRA encoded speech to 
allow for transcoder free operation (tandem-free operation) and where transcoding is not provided the 

referenced specification describes a means to transport the TETRA encoded speech over 64 kbit/s TDM 

bearers. 
A.4.2 Delivery of packetized Content of Communication (CC) 
(general) The operation for transmission of UUS and SMS may use the same mechanisms as used for HI2, or a dedicated link 
may be used. The ROSE operations for the transmission of the Content of Communication (HI3 data interface) shall 

follow the same rules as the one defined for the HI2 interface in clause 8.1. 
A differentiation is made between: 
1) bearer related or bearer unrelated end user information; and 
2) packet data services. 
NOTE: Exceptionally, for the GSM SMS service, this information may be passed via HI2. HI2 may be used 
optionally to pass the UUS information to the LEMF. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 37 The physical or logical links supporting the Handover Interface traffic should be dimensioned to handle the bandwidth 
of the expected CC. 
A.4.2.1 Delivery of TETRA CC over packet switched handover networks 
The mechanisms described above apply with the additional constraint that TETRA encoded speech shall be encoded in 

accordance with the mechanisms defined in TS 100 392-3-7 [74].  
A.4.3 Control information for circuit switched Content of 
Communication (CC) The delivery calls shall use unmodified standard ISDN protocols (DSS1, ISDN user part). Table A.4.1 summarizes 
specific settings of parameters for the CC links. The User-to-User service 1 parameter is used during call set up (within 
the ISUP Initial Address Message (EN 300 356 [5]) or DSS1 Set Up Message (EN 300 403-1 [6]), respectively) to 

transmit LI-specific control information. This information is carried transparently and delivered to the specific LEMF 

remote user. 
To identify the delivered information, including correlating the delivery calls with the IRI records, parameters 1 to 3 
and 5 shall be included in the call set up. Parameters 6 to 9 specify settings of further relevant information. Other 
parameters of the ISDN protocols shall correspond to normal basic calls.

 Parameters 2, 3 and 4 are also present in the IRI records, for correlation with the CC links. Parameter 5 indicates in case 
of separate transmission of each communication direction, which part is carried by a CC link. Parameter 6, the basic 
service of the target call, can be used by the LEMF for processing of the CC signal, e.g. to apply compression methods 

for speech signals, in order to save storage space. Parameter 7 contains the CUG of the LEA. It is optionally used at set 

up the CC link to the LEA. Parameter 8, the basic service of the CC link, is set to "64 kbit/s unrestricted": All 
information of the R
x, Tx channels can be transmitted fully transparently to the LEA. The setting of the ISDN user part 
indicator guarantees, that the services supporting the LI CC link delivery are available for the complete CC link 
connection. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 38 The MF uses en-bloc dialling, i.e. there exists only one message in forward direction to the LEA. 
NOTE: The LEMF should at reception of the set up message not use the alerting state, it should connect 
immediately, to minimize time delay until switching through the CC links. Not all networks will support 

such a transition. Exceptionally, it may be necessary to send an alerting message before the connected 

message. 
The maximum length of the user information parameter can be more than the minimum length of 35 octets (national 
option, see EN 300 356 [5]), i.e. the network transmitting the CC links shall support the standard maximum size of 
131 octets for the UUS1 parameter. 
The User-to-User service 1 parameter cannot be discarded by the ETSI ISUP procedures: the only reason, which would 
allow the ISUP procedures to discard it would be, if the maximum length of the message carrying UUS1 would be 

exceeded. With the specified amount of services used for the CC links, this cannot happen. 
The signalling messages of the two CC channels (stereo mode) carry the same parameter values, except for the direction 
indication. 
See clause D.8 for the ASN.1 definition of the UUS1 LI specific content of the UUS1 parameter. 
A.4.4 Exception handling 
A.4.4.1 Failure of CC links 
If a CC link cannot be set up, a certain number of repeat attempts during a certain period of time shall be made. 
NOTE: Typical values are three tries during 10 s. 
In case of a delay or total failure to transmit the Content of Communication, the target call is handled fully independent 
of the CC link, the CC information gets lost. 
A.4.4.2 Fault reporting 
For several events the target switching function sends messages to the NWO/AP/SvP administration centre. Some 

example events are given in table A.4.2. 
Alternatively, all or some of these events may be transmitted directly to the LEMF. In this case, they are part of the LI 
management notification type of information. 
Delivery to the NWO/AP/SvP administration centre is not part of the HI.

 General CC link set up failure 
 A.4.5 Security requirements at the interface port HI3 
The process of access verification and additional (optional) authentication between the MF and the LEMF shall not 
delay the set up of the CC. 
For the protection and access verification of the Content of Communication (CC) delivery call the ISDN supplementary 
services CLIP, COLP and CUG shall be used when available in the network involved. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 39 Generally any authentication shall be processed before the set-up of the CC links between the MF and the LEMF is 
completed. If this is technically not feasible the authentication may be processed after completion of the CC connection 

in parallel to the existing connection. 
A.4.5.1 LI access verification 
The supplementary service CLIP shall be used to check for the correct origin of the delivery call. 
NOTE: When using CLIP, the supplementary service CLIR is not applicable. 
The supplementary service COLP shall be used to ensure that only the intended terminal on the LEA's side accepts 
incoming calls from the Handover Interface (HI). 
To ensure access verification the following two checks shall be performed: 
- check of Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP) at the LEMF; and 

- check of COnnected Line identification Presentation (COLP) at the Handover Interface (HI) (due to the fact 
that the connected number will not always be transported by the networks involved, there shall be the 

possibility for deactivating the COLP check for a given interception measure. In addition, the COLP check 
shall accept two different numbers as correct numbers, i.e. the user provided number and the network provided 
number. Usually, the user provided number contains a DDI extension). 
A.4.5.2 Access protection 
In order to prevent faulty connections to the LEA, the CC links may be set up as CUG calls. 
In this case, the following settings of the CUG parameters should be used: 
- Incoming access: not allowed; 

- Outgoing access: not allowed; 

- Incoming calls barred within a CUG: no; 
- Outgoing calls barred within a CUG: yes. 
A.4.5.3 Authentication 
In addition to the minimum access verification mechanisms described above, optional authentication mechanisms 
according to the standard series ISO 9798: "Information technology - Entity authentication" parts 1 to 5 may be used 

(see bibliography). 
These mechanisms shall only be used in addition to the access verification and protection mechanisms. 
A.5 LI procedures for circuit switched supplementary 
services A.5.1 General 
In general, LI shall be possible for all connections and activities in which the target is involved. The target shall not be 
able to distinguish alterations in the offered service. It shall also not be possible to prevent interception by invoking 

supplementary services. Consequently, from a supplementary services viewpoint, the status of interactions with LI is 

"no impact", i.e. the behaviour of supplementary services shall not be influenced by interception. 
Depending on the type of supplementary service, additional CC links to the LEA may be required, in addition to already 
existing CC links. 
Within the IRI records, the transmission of additional, supplementary service specific data may be required. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 40 Supplementary services, which have an impact on LI, with respect to CC links or IRI record content, are shown in 
table A.5.1. The table is based on ISDN services (DSS1 protocol specifications), it considers the services which have 

been standardized at the time of finalizing the present document. Future services should be treated following the same 

principles. 
NOTE 1: Co-ordination of handling of new services should be performed via ETSI/TC LI. If required, additions 
will be included in a subsequent version of the present document. 
Services defined for other signalling protocols, which can be related to the services in the table shall be treated in the 
same manner (see also below). Other protocols are e.g.: 
- Analogue user signalling; in general, no ETSI standards are available for supplementary services. 

- Mobile user protocols of the GSM, defined within the MAP (TS GSM 09.02 [32]). 
The question of Lawful Interception (LI) with Intelligent Networks is not covered in the present document (see note 2). 
NOTE 2: The general principle is, that LI takes place on the basis of a technical identity, i.e. a directory number. 
Only numbers which are known to the NWO/AP/SvP, and for which LI has been activated in the standard 

way, can be intercepted. No standardized functions are available yet which would enable an SCF to 

request from the SSF the invocation of LI for a call. 
Additional CC links are only required, if the target is the served user. IRI Records may also carry data from other 
parties being served users. 
Clause A.6 specifies details for relevant services: 
- The procedures for CC links, depending on the call scenario of the target. 

- Related to the IRI records, the point in time of sending and supplementary service specific information. 

- Additional remarks for services with "no impact" on LI. 
The specifications for supplementary services interactions are kept as far as possible independent of the details of the 
used signalling protocols; service related events are therefore described in more general terms, rather than using 
protocol dependent messages or parameters. 
Interactions with services of the same family, like call diversion services, are commonly specified, if the individual 
services behaviour is identical, with respect to LI. 
With respect to the IRI records, clause A.6 specifies typical cases; the general rules for data which shall be included in 
IRI records are defined in clause 8, specifically in clauses A.3.3 and A.5.3. 
Services, which are not part of table A.5.1, do not require the generation of LI information: no CC links are generated or 
modified, and no specific information on the service is present in the IRI records. That is, these services have 
"no impact" on LI; no special functions for LI are required. However, within the IIF, functions may be required to 

realize the principle, that the service behaviour shall not be influenced by LI. 
"No impact" is not automatically applicable for new services. Each new service has to be checked for its impact on LI. 
Additionally, also services using other than the DSS1 protocols, which cannot be related to one of the DSS1 based 
services, may have impact on LI. 
The present document does not intend to give a complete description of all possible cases and access types of 
interactions with supplementary services.

   ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 42 A.5.2 CC link Impact 
The column "CC links: additional calls, impact" (see table A.5.1) defines, whether: 
- for the related service CC links shall be set up, in addition to the CC links for a basic call; 
- already existing calls are impacted, for example by disconnecting their information flow. 
The CC link impact relates always to actions of a target being the served user. Services invoked by other parties have no 
CC link impact. 
A.5.3 IRI impact, general principle for sending IRI records 
The column "IRI items related to service" (see table A.5.1) specifies, which parameters may be transmitted to the LEA 

within the IRI records. For several services, it is differentiated, whether the target or the other party is the served user. 
The table specifies, which parameters are applicable in principle. That is, these parameters are normally sent to the 
LEA, immediately when they are available from the protocol procedures of the service. In many cases, additional IRI-
CONTINUE records, compared to a basic call, will be generated. However, not each service related signalling event 
needs to be sent immediately within an individual record. Exceptions may exist, where several events are included in 

one record, even if this would result in some delay of reporting an event (this may be implementation dependent). Each 

record shall contain all information, which is required by the LEA to enable the interpretation of an action. 
EXAMPLE: The indication of call forwarding by the target shall include the forwarded-to number and the 
indication of the type of forwarding within the same record. 
The complete set of parameters, which are applicable for IRI, is specified in clause A.3.3 (see tables A.3.2 and A.3.3). 
If during procedures involving supplementary services protocol parameters, which are listed in tables A.3.2 and A.3.3 
become available, they shall be included in IRI Records. This rule is directly applicable for parameters received via 

ISUP and DSS1 signalling protocols. Regarding all other protocols, e.g. of analogue users, the mapping to the ISDN 

protocols, as defined in clause A.3.3 is assumed, before discriminating, which (mapped) parameters are copied to the 

IRI records. 
IRI data are not stored by the IIF or MF for the purpose of keeping information on call context or call configuration, 
including complex multiparty calls. The LEMF (electronically) or the LEA's agent (manually) shall always be able, to 

find out the relevant history on the call configuration, to the extent, which is given by the available signalling protocol 

based information, within the telecommunication network. 
Service invocations, which result in invoke and return result components (as defined in table A.3.2) need only be 
reported in case of successful invocations. One IRI record, containing the invoke component, possibly including 
additional parameters from the return result component, is sufficient. Instead of the DSS1 functional protocol 
components, for specific networks other ETSI-standardized components may be used, e.g. of the MAP 

(TS GSM 09.02 [32]). 
With respect to the inclusion of LI specific parameters, see also the parameter specifications and example scenarios in 
clause E.3 for more details. 
Details of e.g. the definition of the used record type, their content, the exact points in time of sending, etc. follow from 
the according service specifications; in some cases, they are specified explicitly in clauses A.6 and E.3. 
A.5.4 Multi party calls - general principles, options A, B 
Each network must adopt option A or B according to local circumstances. 
With respect to IRI, each call or call leg owns a separate IRI transaction sequence, independent of whether it is actually 
active or not. 
With respect to the CC links, two options (A, B) exist, which depend on laws and regulations, see below. Active call or 
call leg means in this context, that the target is actually in communication with the other party of that call or call leg; 

this definition differs from the definition in EN 300 403-1 [6]. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 43 A.5.4.1 CC links for active and non-active calls (option A) 
For each call, active or not, separate CC links shall be provided. This guarantees, that: 
- changes in the call configuration of the target are reflected immediately, with no delay, at the LEMF; 
- the signal from held parties can still be intercepted. 
It is a network option, whether the communication direction of a non-active call, which still carries a signal from the 
other party, is switched through to the LEMF, or switched off.

A.5.4.2 Reuse of CC links for active calls (option B) 
CC links are only used for calls active in their communication phase. Changes in the call configuration may not be 
reflected at the LEMF immediately, because switching in the IIF/MF is required, and the signal from the held party is 

not available. 
Each time, another target call leg uses an existing CC link, an IRI-CONTINUE record with the correct CID and CCLID 
shall be sent. 
NOTE: Even when option B is used, more than one CC link may be required simultaneously.

-05) 44 A.5.5 Subscriber Controlled Input (SCI): 
Activation/Deactivation/Interrogation of services 
For user procedures for control of Supplementary Services (Activation/Deactivation/Interrogation), a special IRI record 
type (IRI-REPORT record) is defined to transmit the required information. 
If the DSS1 Functional Protocol (EN 300 196-1 [29]) is used by the target, the functional information elements, usually 
ASN.1 encoded, are copied to the IRI-REPORT record as received by the target exchange. In case of analogue targets 
or use of the ISDN keypad protocol (EN 300 122-1 [39]) (digits or IA5-characters), other appropriate parameters 
identifying the services are used. They may consist of the string sent by the user, or system-specific parameters, which 

identify the service sufficiently. 
The IRI-REPORT record shall contain an indicator, whether the request of the target has been processed successfully or 
not. 
At the exchange, where the subscriber data of a target shall be modified via a remote control procedure, an 
IRI-REPORT record shall be generated as if the control procedure had taken place locally. 
A.6 Detailed procedures for circuit switched 
supplementary services 
A.6.1 Advice of Charge services (AOC) 
No impact. 
Advice of Charge information is not included in IRI records. 
A.6.2 Call Waiting (CW) 
A.6.2.1 Call Waiting (CW) at target: CC links 
In case of option A "CC links for all calls", a CC link is set up for the waiting call, using the standard procedures for 
terminating calls. In case of option B "CC links for active calls", no CC link is set up for the waiting call, it is treated 

like a held call. 
With respect to CC links, the same configurations as for Call Hold apply. 
Procedure, when the target accepts the waiting call: see retrieve of a held call (see clause A.6.3). 
A.6.2.2 Call Waiting: IRI records 
A.6.2.2.1 Target is served user 
If Call Waiting is invoked at the target access by another (calling) party: the IRI-BEGIN record or a following IRI-
CONTINUE record for the waiting call shall contain the LI specific parameter 
call waiting indication
. A.6.2.2.2 Other party is served user 
If Call Waiting is invoked at the other (called) party's access: if a 
CW notification
 is received by the target's switching 
node, it shall be included in an IRI-CONTINUE record; it may be a separate record, or the next record of the basic call 

sequence. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 45 A.6.3 Call Hold/Retrieve 
A.6.3.1 CC links for active and non-active calls (option A) 
If an active call is put on hold, its CC links shall stay intact; as an option, the signal from the held party is not switched 
through to the LEMF. 
If the target sets up a new call, while one call is on hold, this call is treated like a normal originating call, i.e. a new LI
 configuration (CC links, IRI records) is established. 
A.6.3.2 Reuse of CC links for active calls (option B) 
If an active call is put on hold, its CC links shall not immediately be disconnected; as an option, the signal from the held 
party is not switched through to the LEMF. 
If the target sets up a new call, or retrieves a previously held call, while one target call, which still owns CC links, is on 
hold, these CC links shall be used for the signals of the new active call. 
A.6.3.3 IRI records 
A.6.3.3.1 Invocation of Call Hold or Retrieve by target 
An IRI-CONTINUE record with the LI specific parameter hold indication or retrieve indication, respectively, shall be 

sent. 
A.6.3.3.2 Invocation of Hold or Retrieve by other parties 
An IRI-CONTINUE record with a call hold or retrieve notification shall be sent if it has been received by the signalling 

protocol entity of the target call. 
A.6.4 Explicit Call Transfer (ECT) 
A.6.4.1 Explicit Call Transfer (ECT), CC link 
During the preparation phase of a transfer, the procedures for Call Hold/Retrieve are applicable. 
If the served (transferring) user is the target, its original call is released. This terminates also the CC link, and causes an
 IRI-END record to be sent. 
After transfer, two options exist: 
1) For the transferred call, CC links (and IRI records) shall be generated, in principle like for a forwarded call 
(similar to procedures in clause A.6.16.1, case b). 
2) The transferred call shall not be intercepted. 
A.6.4.2 Explicit Call Transfer (ECT), IRI records 
In addition to the basic or hold/retrieve/waiting call related records and parameters, during the reconfiguration of the 
call, ECT-specific information at the target's access is sent to the LEMF within IRI-CONTINUE records. 
When the target leaves the call after transfer, an IRI-END record is sent, and the LI transaction is terminated. Options 
for the new call, after transfer: see clause A.6.4.1. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 46 A.6.5 Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP) (IRI Records) 
A.6.5.1 Call originated by target (other party is served user) 
The standard CLI parameter of an originating target is included as a supplementary service parameter in the IRI records. 
If for the access (BRI or PRI) of the target a special arrangement according to EN 300 089 [54] exists, whereby the user 
provides a user provided, not screened number, this number is included in the IRI-BEGIN record (originating-Party 
information), as a generic number parameter. The network provided default number of the access is, as without this 
arrangement, also included in the IRI record.
 A.6.5.2 Call terminated at target (target is served user) 
The CLI sent from the other party is included in the IRI-BEGIN record (
originating-Party
 information), irrespective of 
a restriction indication. An eventually received second number (case two number delivery option) is included in the IRI 

record as supplementary services information (Generic Number parameter). 
A.6.6 Calling Line Identification Restriction (CLIR) 
For use by LI, the restriction is ignored, but copied within the CLI parameter to the IRI record. 
A.6.7 COnnected Line identification Presentation (COLP) 
A.6.7.1 Call terminated at target (other party is served user) 
A connected number parameter received from the target shall be included in an IRI record (terminating-Party 

information). In cases where a special arrangement applies, the user provided and the network provided default number 

of the access is included in the IRI record. 
A.6.7.2 Call originated by target (target is served user) 
If available, a connected number parameter as received from the other (terminating) party shall be included in an IRI 

record (terminating-Party information). Any additional number, e.g. a Generic Number, shall also be included in the IRI 

record. A.6.8 COnnected Line identification Restriction (COLR) 
For use by LI, the restriction is ignored, but copied within the COL parameter to the IRI record. 
A.6.9 Closed User Group (CUG) 
In case of a CUG call, the closed user group interlock code shall be included in an IRI. 
A.6.10 Completion of Call to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) 
No impact. 
The first call, which meets a (terminating) busy subscriber, and is released subsequently, is treated like a standard busy 
call, with no CCBS related IRI information. 
The procedures for CCBS, until starting a new call attempt from the served user to the terminating user, including the 
CCBS recall, are not subject of LI. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 47 A.6.11 CONFerence call, add-on (CONF) 
A.6.11.1 CONFerence calls, add on: CC links 
The CC links carry the same bit stream as sent to/received from the target, that is, the R
x call contains the sum signal of 
the conference, and the T
x call contains the signal from the target. 
The general rules for multi party calls (see clause A.5.4) apply also for the various possible states during a conference 
(isolate, split, etc.). The call to the conference device as such is treated like a standard call. In case of a n-party 

conference, there exist n + 1 CC links in case of option "CC link for all calls", or just one CC link, in case of option 

"CC link for active calls". 
A.6.11.2 Conference calls: IRI records 
In addition to the basic or hold/retrieve/waiting call related records and parameters, during the set up and eventual 

reconfigurations of a conference, CONF-specific information is sent to the LEMF within IRI records. 
A.6.12 Three Party Service (Conference) 
A.6.12.1 CC links 
a) Target is conference controller: 
The 3PTY conference originates from a configuration with two single calls (one active, one held). When 

joining the calls to a conference, the CC links, which have carried the signals of the active target call are used 

to transmit the conference signals; that is, the R
x call contains the sum signal of the conference, the T
x call contains the signal from the target. 
 The second CC link set, for the previously held call stays intact. If the conference is released, and the initial 
state (1 held, 1 active call) is re-established, the required CC links are still available. 
b) Target is passive party of conference: 
No impact on CC links. 
A.6.12.2 Three Party Service, IRI Records 
For the events indicating the start and the end of the 3PTY conference, IRI records are generated. 
A.6.13 Meet-Me Conference (MMC) 
No impact; calls to a MMC are treated as standard calls; the MMC device is not required to be subject of LI. 
A.6.14 Direct Dialling In (DDI) 
LI may be applied to a PABX access DN or to a DDI extension number according to national laws and requirements. 
A.6.15 Multiple Subscriber Number (MSN) 
LI shall be activated individually per MSN. 
If LI has to be activated for a whole ISDN BA, activation commands shall be input by the LI administrator for each 
number; administrative procedure shall ensure, that all numbers are covered. If during a surveillance a MSN is added or 

removed, a LI administrative message shall be generated, see clause 7.2. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 48 A.6.16 DIVersion services (DIV) 
Calls to a target, with a called party number equal to the intercepted target DN(s), but forwarded, are intercepted, 
i.e. CC links are set up, and IRI records are sent to the LEA. This applies for all kinds of call forwarding. 
For calls forwarded by the other party (calling or called), the available diversion-related information is sent to the LEA. 
A.6.16.1 Call Diversion by target 
A.6.16.1.1 Call Diversion by target, CC links 
In order to handle call diversion services by applying, as far as possible, common procedures, the following two cases 
are differentiated: 
a) Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU), Call Forwarding Busy (NDUB): 
In these cases, forwarding is determined, before seizing the target access. CC links are set up, immediately, for 

the forwarded call. 
 Other variants of Call Forwarding (CF) with immediate forwarding, i.e. without first seizing the target access, 
are handled in the same way (e.g. unconditional Selective Call Forwarding). 
b) Call Forwarding No Reply, Call Forwarding Busy (UDUB), Call Deflection, Partial Rerouting: 
Initially, the target call is set up, and the call is intercepted like a basic call. 
 When forwarding takes place (e.g. after expiry of the CFNR timer), the original call is released; this may cause 
also a release of the CC links. In such case two optional IRI record handling may apply: 
1) For the original call an IRI-END record is sent. For the forwarded call a new set up procedure, including 
new LI transaction may take place with new set of IRI records (starting with IRI-BEGIN record sent to 

the LEA). 
2) For the forwarded call the IRI-CONTINUE record is generated and sent to a LEA, indicating the CFNR 
invocation. 
Other variants of Call Forwarding (CF) with forwarding after first seizing the target access, are handled in the same 
way. 
In case of multiple forwarding, one call may be intercepted several times, if several parties are targets. Considering the 
maximum number of diversions for one call of 5 (ITU recommended limit), one call can be intercepted 7 times, from 

the same or different LEAs. In principle, these procedures are independent of each other. 
A.6.16.1.2 Call Diversion by target, IRI records 
See clause A.3.2.3, case 2, related to the target's information, and case 3, related to the forwarded-to-party information. 
As above for the CC links, the diversion types a) and b1, 2) are differentiated:  
 for case a) and b2) diversions, the IRI is part of one transaction, IRI-BEGIN, -CONTINUE, -END;  
 for case b1) diversions, a first transaction informs about the call section, until diversion is invoked 
(corresponding to a basic, prematurely released call), a second transaction informs about the call section, when 

diversion is invoked (corresponding to case a)). 
A.6.16.2 Forwarded call terminated at target 
The CC link is handled in the standard way. The IRI-BEGIN record contains the available call diversion information, 

see clause A.3.2.3, case 1. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 49 A.6.16.3 Call from target forwarded 
The CC link is handled in the standard way. The IRI-BEGIN and possibly IRI-CONTINUE records contain the 
available call diversion related information, see clause A.3.2.3, case 3. 
A.6.17 Variants of call diversion services 
Variants of the above "standard" diversion services are treated in the same way as the corresponding "standard" 

diversion service. 
A.6.18 Void 
A.6.19 Malicious Call IDentification (MCID) 
CC links: no impact. 
IRI records: If a terminating target or other party invokes MCID, the MCID response indicator parameter shall be 
included in a dedicated or the next regular IRI record. 
A.6.20 SUBaddressing (SUB) 
The different types of subaddress information elements are part of the IRI records, in all basic and supplementary 

services cases, where they are present. 
A.6.21 Terminal Portability (TP) 
A.6.21.1 CC links 
No impact. 
A.6.21.2 IRI records 
A.6.21.2.1 Invocation of Terminal Portability by target 
Sending of the LI parameters suspend indication or resume indication in an IRI-CONTINUE record. 
A.6.21.2.2 Invocation of Terminal Portability by other parties 
Sending of the generic notification indicator, values user suspended or user resumed in an IRI-CONTINUE record. 
A.6.22 User-to-User Signalling (UUS) 
User-to-User parameters of services UUS1, UUS2 and UUS3 shall be reported as HI3, see clause A.4, or via HI2, 
see clause A.5. 
If User-User information is not delivered from a target to the other party (e.g. due to overload in the SS No.7 network), 
no notification is sent to the LEA. 
A.6.23 Abbreviated Address (AA) 
No impact. The service access code and abbreviated number (user input) is not included in IRI records. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 50 A.6.24 Fixed Destination Call (FDC) 
No impact. The service access code (if applicable) is not included in IRI records. 
A.6.25 Alarm Call (AC)/Wake-Up Service (WUS) 
No impact. A Wake-up call is intercepted in the standard way; the identity of the originating party may be missing. 
A.6.26 Incoming Call Barring (ICB) 
No impact. 
a) Case terminating call to a target with ICB active: 
In general, the barring condition of a target is detected before the target access is determined, consequently, an 
IRI-REPORT records is generated.  
If the access would be determined, a standard IRI-END record is generated, with the applicable cause value. 
b) Case target calls a party with ICB active: 
In general, an IRI-BEGIN record has been sent already, and CC links have been set up. Consequently, a 
standard IRI-END record is generated, with the applicable cause value. 
A.6.27 Outgoing Call Barring (OCB) 
No impact. 
For a barred call, a standard record may be generated; its type and content are depending on the point in the call, where 
the call was released due to OCB restrictions. 
A.6.28 Completion of Calls on No Reply (CCNR) 
No impact. See remarks to service CCBS. 
A.6.29 Reverse charging 
No impact. 
A.6.30 Line hunting 
All accesses of the group shall get the interception profile, independently of each other, if the whole group has to be 

intercepted (responsibility of the LI operator). 
A.6.31 Message Wait Indication (MWI) 
No impact. The information, that a message is waiting, is not sent to the LEA. 
A.6.32 Name display 
No impact. Name strings are not included in IRI records. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 51 A.6.33 Tones, announcements 
No impact. 
If the normal procedures, depending on the call state, result in sending the tone or announcement signal on the R

The reference configuration is only a logical representation of the entities involved in lawful interception and does not 
mandate separate physical entities. This allows for higher levels of integration. 
A call could be intercepted based on several identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI) of the same target. 

Interception based on IMEI could lead to a delay in start of interception at the beginning of a call and interception of 
non-call related events is not possible. 
For the delivery of the CC and IRI the MSC/VLR or GMSC provides correlation number and target identity to the DF2 
and DF3 which is used there in order to select the different LEAs where the product shall be delivered to. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007

Correlation of the present document IDs to 3GPP TS 03.33 [42] IDs. 
The ID Lawful Interception Identifier (LIID) out of the present document is supported at the IIF (GSM) with warrant 
reference number. 
Parameters out of the present document, see clause 6.2: 

Communication IDentifier (CID) 

For each call or other activity relating to a target identity a CID is generated by the relevant network element. The CID 
consists of the following two identifiers: 
- Network IDentifier (NID); 
- Communication Identity Number (CIN). 
Intercepting Node ID is used for the NID in the GSM system. 

The correlation number is used for the CIN.
 For the Communication IDentifier (CID) in the GSM system we use the combination of Interception Node ID and the 
correlation number. 
A.8.3 HI3 (delivery of CC) 
CC will be delivered as described in clause A.4. 
Exceptionally, SMS will be delivered via HI2. 
Correlation information in HI3 will be delivered as described in clause D.8 and as an option annex E. 
A.8.4 HI2 (delivery of IRI) 
The events defined in 3GPP TS 03.33 [42] are used to generate records for the delivery via HI2. 

There are eight different events type received at DF2 level. According to each event, a record is sent to the LEMF if this 
is required. Table A.8.1 gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and record type sent to the LEMF. 
It is an implementation option if the redundant information will be sent for each further event.

 A set of information is used to generate the records. The records used transmit the information from mediation function 
to LEMF. This set of information can be extended in MSC/VLR or GMSC or DF2/MF, if this is necessary in a specific 

country. Table A.8.2 gives the mapping between information received per event and information sent in records. 
IRI-related information, such as receiving MSISDN, which is included as header information in the SMS message body 
that is sent to the SMS service centre, is to be included in IRI records.

information is included in IRI records, even if such information for technical reasons is included in what 

the intercepting network element sees as "contents".

B.1 Specific identifiers for LI 
Beyond clause 6, at present the Correlation Number as specific LI identifier for packet switched networks is defined. 
The Correlation Number is unique per PDP context and is used for the following purposes: 
 correlate CC with IRI; 
 correlate different IRI records within one PDP context. 
As an example, in the GSM GPRS system, the Correlation Number may be the combination of GGSN address and 
charging ID.
 B.2 HI1: interface port for administrative state 
There are no additions beyond clause 7. 
B.3 HI2: interface port for IRI 
B.3.1 Definition of Interception Related Information for packet 
switched 
Intercept related information will in principle be available in the following phases of a data transmission: 
1) At connection attempt when the target identity becomes active, at which time packet transmission may or may 
not occur (set up of a data context, target may be the originating or terminating party). 
2) At the end of a connection, when the target identity becomes inactive (removal of a data context). 

3) At certain times when relevant information are available. 
In addition, information on non-transmission related actions of a target constitute IRI and is sent via HI2, 
e.g. information on Subscriber Controlled Input (SCI). 
The Intercept Related Information (IRI) may be subdivided into the following categories: 
4) Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information). 
5) Basic data context information, for standard data transmission between two parties. 
B.3.2 Exception handling 
Exception handling is a national matter.

 B.5 GPRS technology annex 
B.5.1 Functional architecture 
Figure B.5.1 contains the reference configuration for the lawful interception (see 3GPP TS 03.33 [42]). 
There is one ADMinistration Function (ADMF) in the network. Together with the delivery functions it is used to hide 
from the xGSN that there might be multiple activations by different Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) on the same 
target identity.

 Figure B.5.1: Reference configuration 
The reference configuration is only a logical representation of the entities involved in lawful interception and does not 
mandate separate physical entities. This allows for higher levels of integration. 
A communication could be intercepted based on several identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI) of the same target. 
For the delivery of the CC and IRI the xGSN provides a correlation number and target identity to the DF2P and DF3P 
which is used there to select the different LEAs where the CC/IRI shall be delivered to. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 57 B.5.2 Correlation B.5.2.1 Correlation of the present document IDs to GSM IDs 
The ID Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID) out of the present document is supported at the IIF (GSM) with warrant 
reference number. 
Parameters from the present document, see clause 6.2. 
Communication IDentifier (CID) 
For each communication or other activity relating to a target identity a CID is generated by the relevant network 
element. The CID consists of the following two identifiers: 
- Network IDentifier (NID); 

- Communication Identity Number (CIN). 
NOTE: If interception has been activated for both parties of the packet data communication both CC and IRI will 
be delivered for each party as separate intercept activity. 
B.5.2.2 GPRS LI correlation between CC and IRI 
For the delivery of CC and IRI, the SGSN or GGSN provides correlation numbers and target identities to the HI2 and 

HI3. The correlation number is unique per PDP context and is used to correlate CC with IRI and the different IRIs of 

one PDP context. 
B.5.3 HI2 (delivery of IRI) 
The events defined in 3GPP TS 03.03 [43] are used to generate records for the delivery via HI2. 
There are nine different event types received at DF2 level. According to each event, a record is sent to the LEMF if this 
is required. Table B.5.1 gives the mapping between event type received at DF2 level and record type sent to the LEMF.

shall be the PDP context deactivation or a similar event and an IRI-END record shall be issued. While a PDP context is 
active, IRI-CONTINUE records shall be used for CC relevant IRI data records, IRI-REPORT records otherwise. 
For some packet oriented data services such as GPRS, if LI is being activated during an already established PDP 
context or similar, an IRI-BEGIN record will mark the start of the interception. If LI is being deactivated during an 

established PDP context or similar, no IRI-END record will be transmitted. The end of interception can be 

communicated to the LEA by other means (HI1). 
A set of information is used to generate the records. The records used transmit the information from mediation function 
to LEMF. This set of information can be extended in xGSN or DF2P/MF, if this is necessary in a specific country. 

Table B.5.2 gives the mapping between information received per event and information sent in records.

 Figure C.1.1: Architecture 
The ASE_HI manages the data link, the coding/decoding of the ROSE operations and the sending/receiving of the 
ROSE operations. 
C.1.2 ASE_HI procedures 
C.1.2.1 Sending part 
To request the sending of data to a peer entity, the LI_Application provides the ASE_HI, the address of the peer entity, 

the nature of the data and the data. 
On receiving a request of the LI_Application: 
 If the data link toward the peer entity address is active, the ASE_HI, from the nature of the data provided, 
encapsulates this data in the relevant RO-Invoke operation. 
 If the data link toward the peer entity address is not active, the ASE_HI reports the data link unavailability to 
LI_Application. 
NOTE: Until the data link is established by the LI_Application according to clause C.1.2.3.1, the request of the 
LI_Application cannot be successfully processed by ASE_HI. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 60 Depending on the natures of the data provided by the LI_Application, the ASE_HI encapsulates this data within the 
relevant ROSE operation: 
 LI management notification: in this case the data provided by the application are encoded within the class 2 
RO-Invoke operation "sending-of-HI1-Notification". The ASN.1 format is described in clauses D.2 and D.4 

(HI1 interface). 
 IRI: in this case the data provided by the application are encoded within the class 2 RO-Invoke operation 
"sending-of-IRI". The ASN.1 format is described in clauses D.2 and D.5 (HI2 interface). 
 SMS: in this case the data provided by the application are encoded within the class 2 RO-Invoke operation 
"sending-of-IRI". The ASN.1 format is described in clauses D.2 and D.5 (HI2 interface). 
 User packet data transfer (used for data which can be exchanged via ISUP/DSS1/MAP signalling: e.g. UUS): 
in this case the data provided by the application are encoded: 
- either within the class 2 RO-Invoke operation "circuit-Call-related-Services" in case of data associated to 
a circuit call (for e.g. UUS1, UUS2, UUS3). The ASN.1 format is described in clauses D.2 and D.6 

(HI3 interface); 
- or within the class 2 RO-Invoke operation "no-Circuit-Call-related-Services" in case of data not 
associated with a circuit call (for e.g. SMS). The ASN.1 format is described in clauses D.2 and D.6 

(HI3 interface). 
 TETRA data transfer: in this case all the information provided by the application are encoded within 
the class 2 RO-Invoke operation "Sending
-of-TETRA
-Data". The ASN.1 format is described in 
clauses D.2 and D.7. 
Depending on the class of the operation, the ASE
-HI may have to wait for an answer. In this case a timer, depending on 
the operation, is started on the sending of the operation and stopped on the receipt of an answer (RO_Result, RO_Error, 
RO_Reject). 
On timeout of the timer, the ASE_HI indicates to the LI_Application that no answer has been received. It is under the 
LI_Application responsibility to send again the data or to inform the administrator of the problem. 
On receipt of an answer component (after verification that the component is not erroneous), the ASE_HI stop the 
relevant timer and acts depending on the type of component: 
 On receipt of a RO_Result, the ASE_HI provide the relevant LI_Application an indication that the data has 
been received by the peer LI_Application and the possible parameters contained in the RO_Result. 
 On receipt of a RO_Error, the ASE_HI provide the relevant LI_Application an indication that the data has not 
been received by the peer LI_Application and the possible "Error cause". The error causes are defined for each 

operation in the relevant ASN.1 script. It is under the LI_Application responsibility to generate or not an alarm 

message toward an operator or administrator. 
 On receipt of a RO_Reject_U/P, the ASE_HI provide the relevant LI_Application an indication that the data 
has not been received by the peer LI_Application and the "Problem cause". The problem causes are defined in 
ITU-T Recommendations X.880 [35] to X.882 [37]. It is under the LI_Application responsibility to send again 

the data or to inform the operator/administrator of the error. 
On receipt of an erroneous component, the ASE_HI acts as described in ITU-T Recommendations X.880 [35] to 
X.882 [37]. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 61 C.1.2.2 Receiving part 
On receipt of a ROSE operation from the lower layers: 
 When receiving operations from the peer entity, the ASE_HI verifies the syntax of the component and 
transmits the parameters to the LI_Application. If no error/problem is detected, in accordance with 

the X.880 [35] to X.882 [37] standard result (only Class2 operation are defined), the ASE_HI sends back a 

RO_Result which coding is determined by the relevant operation ASN.1 script. The different operations which 

can be received are: 
- RO-Invoke operation "sending-of-HI1-Notification" (HI1 interface); 
- RO-Invoke operation "sending-of-IRI" (HI2 interface); 
- RO-Invoke operation "circuit-Call-related-Services" (HI3 interface); 
- RO-Invoke operation "no-Circuit-Call-related-Services" (HI3 interface); 
- RO-Invoke operation "Sending-of-TETRA-Data" (HI3 interface). 
In case of error, the ASE_HI acts depending on the reason of the error or problem: 
 In accordance with the rules defined by ITU-T Recommendations X.880 [35] to X.882 [37], a RO_Error is 
sent in case of unsuccessfully operation at the application level. The Error cause provided is one among those 

defined by the ASN.1 script of the relevant operation. 
 In accordance with the rules defined in ITU-T Recommendations X.880 [35] to X.882 [37], a RO_Reject_U/P 
is sent in case of erroneous component. On receipt of an erroneous component, the ASE_HI acts as described 

in ITU-T Recommendations X.880 [35] to X.882 [37]. 
C.1.2.3 Data link management 
This function is used to establish or release a data link between two peer LI_Applications entities (MF and LEMF). 
C.1.2.3.1 Data link establishment 
Depending on a per destination address configuration data, the data link establishment may be required either by the 

LEMF LI_Application or by the MF LI_Application. 
To request the establishment of a data link toward a peer entity, the LI_Application provides, among others, the 
destination address of the peer entity (implicitly, this address defined the protocol layers immediately under the 

ASE_HI: TCP/IP, X25, etc.). On receipt of this request, the ASE_HI request the establishment of the data link with 
respect of the rules of the under layers protocol. 
As soon as the data link is established, the requesting LI_Application initiates an authentication procedure: 
 The origin LI_Application requests the ASE_HI to send the class 2 RO-Invoke operation 
"sending-of-Password" which includes the "origin password" provided by the LI_Application. 
 The peer LI_Application, on receipt of the "origin password" and after acceptance, requests to its ASE_HI to 
send back a RO_Result. In addition, this destination application requests the ASE_HI to send the class 2 RO-
Invoke operation "sending-of-Password" which includes the "destination password" provided by the 
LI_Application. 
 The origin LI_Application, on receipt of the "destination password" and after acceptance, requests to its 
ASE_HI to send back a RO_Result. This application is allowed to send data. 
 After receipt of the RO_Result, this application is allowed to send data. 
In case of erroneous password, the data link is immediately released and a "password error indication" is sent toward the 
operator.
   ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 62 Optionally a 
Data link test
 procedure may be used to verify periodically the data link: 
 When no data have been exchanged during a network dependent period of time toward an address, (may vary 
from 1 minute to 30 minutes) the LI_Application requests the ASE_HI to send the class 2 RO-Invoke 

operation "data-Link-Test". 
 The peer LI_Application, on receipt of this operation, requests to its ASE_HI to send back a RO_Result. 
 On receipt of the Result the test is considered valid by the LI_Application. 
 If no Result is received or if a Reject/Error message is received, the LI_Application requests the ASE_LI to 
release the data link and send an error message toward the operator. 
C.1.2.3.2 Data link release 
 The End of the connection toward the peer LI_Application is under responsibility of the LI_Application. 
E.g. the End of the connection may be requested in the following cases: 
- when all the data (IRI, etc.) has been sent. To prevent unnecessary release, the datalink may be released 
only when no LI_Application data have been exchanged during a network dependent period of time; 
- the data link is established when a call is intercepted and released when the intercepted call is released 
(and all the relevant data have been sent); 
- for security purposes; 
- for changing of password or address of the LEMF/IIF;  
- etc.  To end the connection a LI_Application requests the ASE_HI to send the class 2 RO-Invoke operation 
"end-of-Connection". 
 The peer LI_Application, on receipt of this operation, requests to its ASE_HI to send back a RO_Result. 
 On receipt of the Result the LI_Application requests the ASE_LI to release the data link. 
 If no Result is received after a network dependent period of time, or if a Reject/Error message is received, the 
LI_Application requests the ASE_LI to release the data link and to send an error message toward the 
operator/administrator.

C.1.3 Void 
 C.2 FTP 
C.2.1 Introduction 
At HI2 interface FTP is used over Internet protocol stack for the delivery of the IRI. The FTP is defined in 

RFC 959 [46]. The IP is defined in RFC 791 [51]. The TCP is defined in RFC 793 [52]. 
FTP supports reliable delivery of data. The data may be temporarily buffered in the Mediation Function (MF) in case of 
link failure. FTP is independent of the payload data it carries. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 63 C.2.2 Usage of the FTP 
The MF acts as the FTP client and the LEMF acts as the FTP server. The client pushes the data to the server. 
The receiving node LEMF stores the received data as files. The MF may buffer files. 
Several records may be gathered to bigger packages prior to sending, to increase bandwidth efficiency. 
The following configurable intercept data collection (= transfer package closing/file change) threshold parameters 
should be supported: 
- frequency of transfer, based on send timeout, e.g. X ms; 

- frequency of transfer, based on volume trigger, e.g. X octets. 
Every file shall contain only complete IRI records. The single IRI record shall not be divided into several files. 
There are two possible ways how the interception data may be sent from the MF to the LEMF. One way is to produce 
files that contain interception data only for one observed target (ref: "File naming method A)"). The other way is to 

multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence of general purpose interception files sent by the 

MF (ref: "File naming method B)"). 
File naming: 
The names for the files transferred to a LEA are formed according to one of the two available formats, depending on the 
delivery file strategy chosen (e.g. due to national convention or operator preference). 
Either each file contains data of only one observed target (as in method A) or several targets' data is put to files common 
to all observed target traffic through MF (as in method B). 
The maximum set of allowed characters in interception file names are "a"–"z", "A"–"Z", "-", "_", ".", and decimals 
"0"–"9". 
File naming method A): 
<LIID>_<seq>.<ext> 
where: 
LIID
 =  As defined in the present document clause "Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID)". This field has 
a character string (or digit string for subaddress option) value, e.g. "ABCD123456". This is a 

unique interception request identifier allocated by the ADMF. It will be given by the ADMF to the 
LEA via the HI1 interface after the ADMF has been authorized to command the start of the 
interception of a specific target. The possible network operator identifier part used should be 

agreed with (and allocated by) the regulatory organization administrating the local 

telecommunication practises. 
seq
 =  Integer ranging between [0–.2
64-1
], in ASCII form (not exceeding 20 ASCII digits), identifying 
the sequence number for file transfer from this node per a specific target. 
ext
 =  ASCII integer ranging between ["1"..."8"] (in hex: 31H...38H), identifying the file type. The 
possible file types are shown in table C.2.1. Type "1" is reserved for IRI data files and type "8" is 
reserved for data files according to a national requirement by using the same file naming concept. 
 Table C.2.1: Possible file types 
File types that the LEA may get 
Intercepted data types 
"1" (in binary: 0011 0001) IRI 
"8" (in binary: 0011 1000) for national use 
 This alternative A is used when each target's IRI is gathered per observed target to dedicated delivery files. This method 
provides the result of interception in a very refined form to the LEAs, but requires somewhat more resources in the MF 

than alternative B. With this method, the data sorting and interpretation tasks of the LEMF are considerably easier to 

facilitate in near real time than in alternative B. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 64 File naming method B): 
The other choice is to use monolithic fixed format file names (with no trailing file type part in the file name): 
<filenamestring> of the format ABXYyymmddhhmmsseeeet 
where: 
AB = Two letter ASCII Operator ID (as agreed with the national telecom regulators). 
XY = Two letter ASCII identification of the MF node (as assigned by the operator). 
yy = Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["00"..."99"], identifying the last two digits of the year. 
mm = Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["01"..."12"], identifying the month. 
dd = Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["01"..."31"], identifying the day. 
hh = Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["00"..."23"], identifying the hour. 
mm = Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["00"..."59"], identifying the minute. 
ss = Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["00"..."59"], identifying the second. 
eeee = Alphanumeric extension made up of four characters chosen at the discretion of the Operator and/or 
the MF to avoid file name clashes within the MF. Each of the position shall be out of "A"..."Z", 

"0"..."9". 
t = ASCII integer ranging between ["1"..."8"] (in hex: 31H...38H), identifying the file type. The 
possible file types are shown in table C.2.1. Type "1" is reserved for IRI data files and type "8" is 
reserved for data files according to a national requirement by using the same file naming concept. 
 EXAMPLE: <filenamestring> (e.g. ABXY00041014084400001) 
where: 
ABXY
 = source node identifier part, used for all files by the mobile network operator "AB" from this MF 
node named "XY". 
00 =  year 2000. 
04 = month April. 
10 =  day 10. 
14 =  hour. 
08 =  minutes. 
44 =  seconds. 
0000 =  extension. 
1 =  file type. The type "1" is reserved for IRI data files and type "8" is reserved for national use.  
(Codings "2" = CC(MO), "4" = CC(MT), "6" = CC(MO&MT) are reserved for HI3). 
This alternative B is used when several targets' intercepted data is gathered to common delivery files. This method does 
not provide the result of interception in as refined form to the LEAs as the alternative A, but it is faster in performance 
for the MF point of view. With this method, the MF does not need to keep many files open like in alternative A. 
C.2.3 Profiles 
NOTE: This clause is informative only. 
As there are several ways (usage profiles) how data transfer can be arranged by using the FTP, this clause contains 
practical considerations how the communications can be set up. Guidance is given for client-server arrangements, 

session establishments, time outs, the handling of the files (in RAM or disk). Example batch file is described for the 

case that the sending FTP client uses files. If instead (logical) files are sent directly from the client's RAM memory, 

then the procedure can be in principle similar though no script file would then be needed. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 65 At the LEMF side, FTP server process is run, and at MF, FTP client. No FTP server (which could be accessed from 
outside the operator network) shall run in the MF. The FTP client can be implemented in many ways, and here the FTP 

usage is presented with an example only. The FTP client can be implemented by a batch file or a file sender program 

that uses FTP via an API. The login needs to occur only once per e.g. <destaddr> and <leauser> - pair. Once the login is 

done, the files can then be transferred just by repeating "mput" command and checking the transfer status (e.g. from the 

API routine return value). To prevent inactivity timer triggering, a dummy command (e.g. "pwd") can be sent every 
T seconds (T should be less than L, the actual idle time limit). If the number of FTP connections is wanted to be as 
minimized as possible, the FTP file transfer method "B" is to be preferred to the method A (though the method A helps 

more the LEMF by pre-sorting the data sent). 
Simple example of a batch file extract: 

FTP commands usage scenario for transferring a list of files: 
To prevent FTP cmd line buffer overflow the best way is to use wildcarded file names, and let the FTP implementation 
do the file name expansion (instead of shell). The number of files for one mput is not limited this way: 
ftp <flags> <destaddr>  user <leauser> <leapasswd>  cd <destpath>  lcd <srcpath>  bin  mput <files>  nlist <lastfile> <checkfile>  close EOF    This set of commands opens an FTP connection to a LEA site, logs in with a given account (auto-login is disabled), 
transfers a list of files in binary mode, and checks the transfer status in a simplified way. 
Brief descriptions for the FTP commands used in the example: 
user <user-name> <password> Identify the client to the remote FTP server. 
cd <remote-directory> Change the working directory on the remote machine to 
remote-directory. lcd <directory> Change the working directory on the local machine. 
bin Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer 
mput <local-files> Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as 
arguments and do a put for each file in the resulting list. Store each local file on the remote machine. nlist <remote-directory> <local-file> Print a list of the files in a directory on the remote 
machine. Send the output to local-file. close Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return 
to the command interpreter. Any defined macros are erased.  The parameters are as follows: 
<flags>
 contains the FTP command options, e.g. "-i -n -V -p" which equals to "interactive prompting off", "auto-login 
disabled", "verbose mode disabled", and "passive mode enabled". (These are dependent on the used ftp-version.) 
<destaddr>
 contains the IP address or DNS address of the destination (LEA) 
<leauser>
 contains the receiving (LEA) username 
<leapasswd>
 contains the receiving (LEA) user's password 
<destpath>
 contains the destination path 
<srcpath>
 contains the source path 
<files>
 wild carded file specification (matching the files to be transferred) 
<lastfile>
 the name of the last file to be transferred 
<checkfile>
 is a (local) file to be checked upon transfer completion; if it exists then the transfer is considered successful 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 66 The FTP application should to do the following things if the check file is not found: 
 keep the failed files; 
 raise "file transfer failure" error condition (i.e. send alarm to the corresponding LEA); 
 the data can be buffered for a time that the buffer size allows. If that would finally be exhausted, DF would 
start dropping the corresponding target's data until the transfer failure is fixed; 
 the transmission of the failed files is retried until the transfer eventually succeeds. Then the DF would again 
start collecting the data; 
 upon successful file transfer the sent files are deleted from the DF. 
The FTP server at LEMF shall not allow anonymous login of an FTP client. 

It is required that FTP implementation guarantees that LEMF will start processing data only after data transfer is 
complete. 
The following implementation example addresses a particular issue of FTP implementation. It is important however to 
highlight that there are multiple ways of addressing the problem in question, and therefore the given example does not 

in any way suggest being the default one. 
 MF sends data with a filename, which indicates that the file is temporary. Once data transfer is complete, MF 
renames temporary file into ordinary one (as defined in clause C.2.2). 
 The procedure for renaming filename should be as follow: 
1) open FTP channel (if not already open) from MF to LEMF; 
2) sends data to LEMF using command "put" with temporary filename; 

3) after MF finished to send the file, renaming it as ordinary one with command "ren". 
 Brief descriptions for the FTP commands used in the example: 
ren <from-name> <to-name>    renaming filename from-name to to-name. 
 If the ftp-client want to send file to LEMF using the command "mput" (e.g. MF stored many IRI files and want 
to send all together with one command), every filename transferred successfully must be renamed each after 

command "mput" ended. 
C.2.4 File content 
The file content is in method A relating to only one intercepted target. 
In the file transfer method B, the file content may relate to any intercepted targets whose intercept records are sent to 
the particular LEMF address. 
Individual IRI records shall not be fragmented into separate files at the FTP layer. 
C.2.5 Exceptional procedures 
Overflow at the receiving end (LEMF) is avoided due to the nature of the protocol. 

In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a reasonably short time period, the local 
buffering at the MF will be sufficient as a delivery reliability backup procedure. 
In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a very long period, the local buffering at the 
MF may have to be terminated. Then the following intercepted data coming from the intercepting nodes to the MF 

would be discarded, until the transit network or LEMF is up and running again. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 67 C.2.6 Other considerations 
The FTP protocol mode parameters used: 
 Transmission Mode: stream 
 Format: non-print 
 Structure: file-structure 
 Type: binary 
The FTP client (= user-FTP process at the MF) uses e.g. the default standard FTP ports 20 (for data connection) and 21 
(for control connection), "passive" mode is supported. The data transfer process listens the data port for a connection 
from a server-FTP process.
 For the file transfer from the MF to the LEMF(s) e.g. the following data transfer parameters are provided for the FTP 
client (at the MF):
 - transfer destination (IP) address, e.g. "194.89.205.4"; 

- transfer destination username, e.g. "LEA1"; 

- transfer destination directory path, e.g. "/usr/local/LEA1/1234-8291"; 
- transfer destination password; 
- interception file type, "1" (this is needed only if the file naming method A is used).
 LEMF may use various kind directory structures for the reception of interception files. It is strongly recommended that 
at the LEMF machine the structure and access and modification rights of the storage directories are adjusted to prevent 

unwanted directory operations by a FTP client. 
Timing considerations for the HI2 FTP transmission: 
The MF and LEMF sides control the timers to ensure reliable, near-real time data transfer. The transmission related 
timers are defined within the lower layers of the used protocol and are out of scope of the present document. 
The following timers may be used within the LI application: 
Table C.2.2: Timing considerations 
Name 
Controlled by 
Units 
Description 
T1 inactivity timer 
LEMF Seconds 
Triggered by no activity within the FTP session (no new files). 
The FTP session is torn down when the T1 expires. To send 
another file the new connection will be established. The timer 
avoids the FTP session overflow at the LEMF side. 
T2 send file trigger 
MF Milliseconds 
Forces the file to be transmitted to the LEMF (even if the size 
limit has not been reached yet in case of volume trigger active). If 
the timer is set to 0 the only trigger to send the file is the file size 
parameter (see clause C.2.2). 
   ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 68 Annex D (normative): 
Structure of data at the Handover Interface 
This annex specifies the coding details at the Handover Interface HI for all data, which may be sent from the 
NWO/AP/SvP's equipment to the LEMF, across HI. 
At the three Handover Interface (HI) ports, the following data may be present: 
- interface port HI1: Interception administration information; 
- interface port HI2: Intercept Related Information (IRI); 

- interface port HI3: records containing Content of Communication (CC). 
The detailed coding specification for these types of information is contained in this annex, including sufficient details 
for a consistent implementation in the NWO/AP/SvP's equipment and the LEMF. 
It must be noticed some data are ROSE specific and have no meaning when FTP is used. Those specificities are 
described at the beginning of each clause (D.3, D.4, D.5 and D.6). 
D.1 Syntax definitions 
The transferred information and messages are encoded to be binary compatible with ITU-

T Recommendations X.680 [33] (Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)) and X.690 [34] (Basic Encoding Rules 

(BER)). 
These recommendations use precise definitions of the words 
type
, class
, value, and 
parameter
. Those definitions are 
paraphrased below for clarity. 
A type
, in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a set of all possible values. For example, an INTEGER 
is a type for all negative and positive integers. 
A class
, in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a one of four possible domains for uniquely defining a 
type. The classes defined by ASN.1 and BER are: UNIVERSAL, APPLICATION, CONTEXT, and PRIVATE. 
The UNIVERSAL class is reserved for international standards such as ITU-T Recommendations X.680 [33] and 
X.690 [34]. Most parameter type identifiers in the HI ROSE operations are encoded as CONTEXT specific class. Users 
of the protocol may extend the syntax with PRIVATE class parameters without conflict with the present document, but 

risk conflict with other users' extensions. APPLICATION class parameters are reserved for future extensions. 
A value is a particular instance of a type. For example, five (5) is a possible value of the type INTEGER. 
A parameter
 in the present document is a particular instance of the transfer syntax to transport a value consisting of a 
tag to identify the parameter type, a length to specify the number of octets in the value, and the value. 
In the BER a 
tag
 (a particular type and class identifier) may either be a primitive or a constructor. A 
primitive
 is a pre-defined type (of class UNIVERSAL) and a 
constructor
 consists of other types (primitives or other constructors). A 
constructor type may either be IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT. An IMPLICIT type is encoded with the constructor identifier 

alone. Both ends of a communication must understand the underlying structure of the IMPLICIT types. EXPLICIT 

types are encoded with the identifiers of all the contained types. For example, an IMPLICIT Number of type INTEGER 
would be tagged only with the 
Number
 tag, where an EXPLICIT number of type INTEGER would have the 
INTEGER
 tag within the 
Number
 tag. The present document uses IMPLICIT tagging for more compact message encoding. 
For the coding of the value part of each parameter the general rule is to use a widely use a standardized format when it 
exists (ISUP, DSS1, MAP, etc.). 
As a large part of the information exchanged between the users may be transmitted within ISUP/DSS1 signalling, the 
using of the coding defined for this signalling guarantee the integrity of the information provided to the LEMF and the 
evolution of the interface. For example if new values are used within existing ISUP parameters, this new values shall be 
transmitted transparently toward the LEMF. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 69 For the ASN.1 parameters of the type "OCTET STRING", the ordering of the individual halfoctets of each octet shall 
be such that the most significant halfoctet is put into bit position 5 to 8 and the least significant halfoctet into bit 

position 1 to 4. This general rule shall not apply when parameter formats are imported from other standards, e.g. an 

E.164 number coded according to ISUP (ITU-T Recommendation Q.763 [48]). In this case the ordering of the halfoctet 

shall be according to that standard and not be changed.

Use of subaddress and calling party number to carry 
correlation information E.1 Introduction 
Not all ISDN networks fully support the use of the UUS1 service EN 300 286-1 [23]. Some networks may be limited to 
the transfer of only 32 octets of UUS1 user information rather than the 128 required for full support of the UUS1 

service. Some networks may not support UUS1 at all. 
This annex describes a procedure to provide correlation information which is appropriate: 
1) if a network does not support the delivery of UUS1; or 

2) if a network does not support the delivery of 128 octets for UUS1. 
If all network involved support the delivery of 128 octets for UUS1 then the procedure (described in this annex) is not 
appropriate. 
The calling party number, the calling party subaddress (CgP Sub) and the called party subaddress (CdP Sub) are used to 
carry correlation information. 
E.2 Subaddress options 
The coding of a subaddress information element is given in EN 300 403-1 [6]. The following options shall be chosen: 
Table E.2.1: Subaddress options 
Option 
Value Type of subaddress user specified 
Odd/even indicator employed for called party subaddress when no national parameters are used 
 E.3 Subaddress coding 
The coding of subaddress information shall be in accordance with EN 300 403-1 [6]. 
E.3.1 BCD values 
The values 0 to 9 shall be BCD coded according to their natural binary values. The hexadecimal value F shall be used as 

a field separator. This coding is indicated in table E.3.1.

Field separator 1 1 1 1 
 When items are packed two to an octet, the least significant item shall be coded by mapping bit 4 to bit 8, bit 3 to bit 7, 
etc. E.3.2 Field order and layout 
Fields shall be presented into the subaddress in the following order: 
Table E.3.2: Fields in the called party subaddress 
Order 
Field 1 Operator-ID 
2 CIN 
3 CCLID 
4 National Parameters 
 Table E.3.3: Fields in the calling party subaddress 
Order 
Field 1 Lawful Interception Identifier (LIID) 
2 Direction 
3 Service Octets 
 Apart from "National Parameters", inclusion and format of which is determined by national regulations, each field noted 
above shall be included, whether empty or not. Each of the Operator-ID, CIN, CCLID, LIID and Direction fields shall 

end by a field separator. 
When the sending entity does not have a valid value for either of Operator-ID, CIN, CCLID, LIID or Direction fields, 
then the field is considered empty and it shall be represented only by its field separator (see table E.3.6 as example of 
the Called party subaddress without the CIN parameter). 
The parameters within the Information Elements "Called Party Subaddress" and "Calling Party Subaddress" are 
variable. Because of this variable length the parameters may start in different octets in the related Information Element. 

I.e. in the Calling Party Subaddress the Direction can be found in octet 17 when the LIID is 25 digits long (table E.3.5). 
When the LIID is composed of less than 25 digits, the field separator and direction indicator "moves up" and the rest of 
the octets is spare till octet 19 as shown in table E.3.7. Between the last digit of the LIID and the Direction is always a 
Field separator (value F). Also after the "Direction" one Field Separator is given. The last Field separator separates the 

relevant data from the spare part. So the location of the TMR and the other service Octets below are fixed within the 

Subaddress. The total length of the Calling Party Subaddress is fixed to 23 octets (including the two Mobile service 

octets) or 21 octets (without the two Mobile service octets). 
The Service Octets as available shall always be mapped into octets 19 to 23 of the Calling Party Subaddress, as 
appropriate. If one of the parameters TMR, BC or HLC is not available, the octet shall be filled with "FF" hex. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 93 In relation to Mobile Bearer Service Code and Mobile Teleservice Code, the mapping of the values into octets 22 and 
23, respectively, shall be done as follows: 
 if both, Mobile Bearer Service Code and Mobile Teleservice Code are provided by signalling, octets 22 and 
23, shall be present, each containing the mapped value; 
 if Mobile Bearer Service Code is provided by signalling, and Mobile Teleservice Code is NOT provided by 
signalling, octet 22 shall be present containing the mapped value, and octet 23 shall be omitted; 
 if Mobile Teleservice Code is provided by signalling, and Mobile Bearer Service Code is NOT provided by 
signalling, there are two implementation options: 
- neither octet 22 nor octet 23 shall be present; 
- octet 22 shall be filled with "FF" hex and octet 23 shall be present containing the mapped value; 
 if neither Mobile Teleservice Code nor Mobile Bearer Service Code is provided by signalling, neither octet 22 
nor octet 23 shall be present. 
As an option the Calling Party Subaddress and Called Party Subaddress may have a variable length. The length is given 
in octet 2. 
When the LIID is composed of less than 25 digits in the Calling Party Subaddress, the Field separator, Direction 
indicator, Field separator and all the Service Octets "moves up" as shown in table E.3.8. 
National Parameters in a variable length Called Party Subaddress may have variable length. 
Table E.3.4 represent called party subaddress and table E.3.5 calling party subaddress with the maximum length of the 
identifiers.

shall be as follows, depending on the type of network access (see note 1): 
Numbering plan identification:
 ISDN/telephony numbering plan (ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [58]). 
Nature of address: As specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.731.3 [63] (see note 1) (e.g. national 
(significant) number or international number) (in case of ISUP signalling). 
Type of number: As specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.951.1 [64] and ITU-
T Recommendation Q.951.3 [65], EN 300 092 [66] (e.g. 
unknown, subscriber number, 
national number or international number), and Network Operator specific type of 
access (BRA or PRA) (in case of DSS1 signalling, see notes 2 and 3). 
Screening indicator: Network provided (in case ISUP signalling). 

Screening indicator: User-provided, not screened (in case of DSS1 signalling, see note 3). 

Presentation indicator: Presentation allowed. 
 NOTE 1: The relevant national specification of the Signalling System Number 7 may also specify requirements on 
the Nature of address for national specific use in national variants of ISUP. 
NOTE 2: Usually, the IIF respectively the Mediation Function is connected to the network by links using Signalling 
System Number 7 and ISDN User Part (ISUP), whereby the parameters are coded according to 

EN 300 356 [5]. But in some cases, the IIF respectively the Mediation Function may be connected via a 

Basic Rate Access or a Primary Rate Access using D-Channel signalling, whereby the parameters are 
coded according to EN 300 403-1 [6]. 
NOTE 3: The network will perform screening, i.e. the number will arrive at the LEMF as "user-provided, verified 
and passed" with the appropriate "type of number" indicator. A network provided number is also accepted 

at the LEMF.

There is one ADMinistration Function (ADMF) in the network. Together with the delivery functions it is used to hide 
from the xGSN that there might be multiple activations by different Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) on the same 

target. 
NOTE: GGSN interception is a national option. 
The reference configuration is only a logical representation of the entities involved in lawful interception and does not 
mandate separate physical entities. This allows for higher levels of integration. 
A call could be intercepted based on several identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI) of the same target. 

For the delivery of the CC and IRI the xGSN provides a correlation number and target identity to the DF2P and DF3P 
which is used there to select the different LEAs where CC/IRI shall be delivered to.

-05) 100 F.3 HI3 Delivery Content of Communication (CC) 
There are two possible methods for delivery of Content of Communication to the LEMF: 
- GPRS LI Correlation (GLIC) Header and UDP/TCP (see clause F.3.1); 

- FTP/TCP (see clause F.3.2). 
According to national requirements al least one of these methods have to be provided. 

However, when TCP is used as across the HI3, real time delivery of the result of the interception cannot be guaranteed. 
NOTE: Apart from transport layer protocol selection, real time delivery depends on network performance. 
F.3.1 GPRS LI correlation header 
F.3.1.1 Introduction 
The header and the payload of the communication between the intercepted subscriber and the other party (later called: 
Information Element) are duplicated. A new header (later called: GLIC-Header, see table F.3.1) is added 
(see table F.3.3) before it is sent to LEMF. 
Data packets with the GLIC header shall be sent to the LEA via UDP or TCP/IP. 
F.3.1.2 Definition of GLIC header 
GLIC header contains the following attributes: 
 correlation number; 
 message type (a value of 255 is used for HI3-PDUs); 
 direction; 
 sequence number; 
 length; 
 GPRS Support Node (GSN) type. 
T-PDU contains the intercepted information.

   ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 101 For interception tunnelling the GLIC header shall be used as follows: 
 version shall be set to 0 to indicate the first version of GLIC header; 
 DIR indicates the direction of the T-PDU: 
- "1" indicating uplink (from observed mobile user); and 
- "0" indicating downlink (to observed mobile user); 
 message type shall be set to 255 (the unique value that is used for T-PDU within GTP (3GPP TS 09.60 [45]); 
 length shall be the length, in octets, of the signalling message excluding the GLIC header. Bit 8 of octet 3 is 
the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 4 is the least significant bit of the length field; 
 sequence number is an increasing sequence number for tunnelled T-PDUs. Bit 8 of octet 5 is the most 
significant bit and bit 1 of octet 6 is the least significant bit of the sequence number field; 
NOTE: When a handoff occurs between SGSNs, the DF3 serving the LEA may change. If the DF3 serving an 
LEA changes as a result of an handoff between SGSNs, contiguous sequencing may not occur as new 
sequencing may be initiated at the new DF3. Accordingly, the LEA should not assume that sequencing is 

contiguous when handoff occurs between SGSNs and the DF3 serving the LEA changes. 
 correlation number consists of two parts: GGSN-ID identifies the GGSN which creates the Charging-ID: 
- Charging-ID is defined in 3GPP TS 09.60 [45] and assigned uniquely to each PDP context activation on 
that GGSN (4 octets). 
- The correlation number consists of 8 octets and guarantees a unique identification of the tunnel to the 
LEA over a long time. The requirements for this identification are similar to that defined for charging in 

3GPP TS 09.60 [45], clause 5.4. Therefore it is proposed to use the Charging-ID, defined in 

3GPP TS 09.60 [45], clause 5.4 as part of correlation number. The Charging-ID is signalled to the new 

SGSN in case of SGSN-change so the tunnel identifier could be used "seamlessly" for the HI3 interface.

This parameter is needed only in case the GGSN and the SGSN use the same Delivery Function/Mediation Function for 
the delivery of Content of Communication (CC). 
The Information Element (IE) contains the header and the payload of the communication between the intercepted 
subscriber and the other party. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 102 F.3.1.3 Exceptional procedure 
With UDP and GLIC: the delivering node does not take care about any problems at LEMF. 
With TCP and GLIC: TCP tries to establish a connection to LEMF and resending (buffering in the sending node) of 
packets is also supported by TCP. 
In both cases it might happen that call content gets lost (in case the LEMF or the transit network between MF and 
LEMF is down for a long time). 
F.3.1.4 Other considerations 
The use of IPsec for this interface is recommended. 
The required functions in LEMF are: 
- Collecting and storing of the incoming packets inline with the sequence numbers. 
- Correlating of CC to IRI with the use of the correlation number in the GLIC header. 
F.3.2 FTP 
F.3.2.1 Introduction 
At HI3 interface FTP is used over the Internet protocol stack for the delivery of the result of interception. FTP is 
defined in RFC 959 [46]. The IP is defined in RFC 791 [51]. The TCP is defined in RFC 793 [52]. 
FTP supports reliable delivery of data. The data may be temporarily buffered in the sending node (MF) in case of link 
failure. FTP is independent of the payload data it carries. 
F.3.2.2 Usage of the FTP 
In the packet data LI the MF acts as the FTP client and the receiving node (LEMF) acts as the FTP server. The client 

pushes the data to the server. 
The receiving node LEMF stores the received data as files. The sending entity (MF) may buffer files. 

Several smaller intercepted data units may be gathered to bigger packages prior to sending, to increase bandwidth 
efficiency. 
The following configurable intercept data collection (= transfer package closing/file change) threshold parameters 
should be supported: 
- frequency of transfer, based on send timeout, e.g. X ms; 

- frequency of transfer, based on volume trigger, e.g. X octets. 
There are two possible ways how the interception data may be sent from the MF to the LEMF. One way is to produce 
files that contain interception data only for one observed target (ref: "File naming method A)"). The other way is to 
multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence of general purpose interception files sent by the 

MF (ref: "File naming method B)"). 
The HI2 and HI3 are logically different interfaces, even though in some installations the HI2 and HI3 packet streams 
might also be delivered via a common transmission path from a MF to a LEMF. It is possible to correlate HI2 and HI3 
packet streams by having common (referencing) data fields embedded in the IRI and the CC packet streams. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 103 File naming: 
The names for the files transferred to a LEA are formed according to one of the 2 available formats, depending on the 
delivery file strategy chosen (e.g. due to national convention or operator preference). 
Either each file contains data of only one observed target (as in method A) or several targets' data is put to files common 
to all observed target traffic through a particular MF node (as in method B). 
The maximum set of allowed characters in interception file names are "a"–"z", "A"–"Z", "-", "_", ".", and 
decimals "0"–"9". 
File naming method A): 
<LIID>_<seq>.<ext> 
LIID
 =  as defined in the present document. This field has a character string value, e.g. "ABCD123456". 
This is a unique interception request identifier allocated by the ADMF. It will be given by the 
ADMF to the LEA via the HI1 interface after the ADMF has been authorized to command the start 
of the interception of a specific target. The possible network operator identifier part used should be 

agreed with (and allocated by) the regulatory organization administrating the local 

telecommunication practises. 
seq
 =  integer ranging between [0..2
64-1
], in ASCII form (not exceeding 20 ASCII digits), identifying the 
sequence number for file transfer from this node per a specific target. 
ext
 =  ASCII integer ranging between ["1"..."8"] (in hex: 31H...38H), identifying the file type. The 
possible file type codings for intercepted data are shown in table F.3.4. The types "2", "4", and "6" 

are reserved for the HI3 interface and type "8" is reserved for data files according to a national 
requirement by using the same file naming concept. 
Table F.3.4: Possible file types 
File types that the LEA may get 
Intercepted data types 
"2" (in binary: 0011 0010) CC (MO) 
"4" (in binary: 0011 0100) CC (MT) 
"6" (in binary: 0011 0110) CC (MO&MT) 
"8" (in binary: 0011 1000) for national use 
 The least significant bit that is "1" in file type 1, is reserved for indicating IRI data 
The bit 2 of the 
ext
 tells whether the Mobile Originated (MO) Content of Communication (CC) is included to the 
intercepted data. 
The bit 3 of the 
ext
 tells whether the Mobile Terminated (MT) Content of Communication (CC) is included to the 
intercepted data.  
The bit 4 of the 
ext
 tells whether the intercepted data is according to a national requirement. 
Thus, for Mobile Originated Content of Communication data, the file type is "2", for MT CC data "4", for MO&MT CC 
data "6" and for "national use" data the file type is "8". 
Thus, for Mobile Originated Content of Communication data, the file type is "2", for MT CC data "4" and for 
MO&MT CC data "6". 
This alternative A is used when each target's intercepted data is gathered per observed target to dedicated delivery files. 
This method provides the result of interception in a very refined form to the LEAs, but requires somewhat more 
resources in the sending node than alternative B. With this method, the data sorting and interpretation tasks of the 
LEMF are considerably easier to facilitate in near real time than in alternative B. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 104 File naming method B): 
The other choice is to use monolithic fixed format file names (with no trailing file type part in the file name): 
<filenamestring> of the format ABXYyymmddhhmmsseeeet 
where: 
AB =  Two letter ASCII Operator ID (as agreed with the national telecom regulators). 
XY =  Two letter ASCII identification of the MF node (as assigned by the operator). 
yy =  Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["00"..."99"], identifying the last to digits of the year. 
mm =  Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["01"..."12"], identifying the month. 
dd =  Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["01"..."31"], identifying the day. 
hh =  Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["00"..."23"], identifying the hour. 
mm =  Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["00"..."59"], identifying the minute. 
ss =  Two digits ASCII integer ranging between ["00"..."59"], identifying the second. 
eeee =  Alphanumeric extension made up of four characters chosen at the discretion of the Operator and/or 
the MF to avoid file name clashes within the MF. Each of the position shall be out of "A"...."Z", 

"0"...."9". 
t =  ASCII integer ranging between ["1"...."8"] (in hex: 31H...38H), identifying the file type. The 
possible file type codings for intercepted data are shown in table F.3.4. 
 EXAMPLE: <filenamestring> (e.g. ABXY00041014084400006) 
where: 
ABXY
 =  Source node identifier part, used for all files by the mobile network operator "AB" from this MF 
node named "XY". 
00 =  year 2000. 
04 =  month April. 
10 =  day 10. 
14 =  hour. 
08 =  minutes. 
44 =  seconds. 
0000 =  extension. 
6 =  file type. Coding: "2" = CC (MO), "4" = CC (MT), "6" = CC (MO&MT), "8" = national use. 
(The type "1" is reserved for IRI data files.) 
This alternative B is used when several targets' intercepted data is gathered to common delivery files. This method does 
not provide the result of interception in as refined form to the LEAs as the alternative A, but it is faster in performance 

for the MF point of view. With this method, the MF does not need to keep many files open like in alternative A. 
F.3.2.3 Profiles 
NOTE: This clause is informative only. 
As there are several ways (usage profiles) how data transfer can be arranged by using the FTP, this clause contains 
practical considerations how the communications can be set up. Guidance is given for client-server arrangements, 

session establishments, time outs, the handling of the files (in RAM or disk). Example batch file is described for the 

case that the sending FTP client uses files. If instead (logical) files are sent directly from the client's RAM memory, 

then the procedure can be in principle similar though no script file would then be needed. 
At the LEMF side, FTP server process is run, and at MF, FTP client. No FTP server (which could be accessed from 
outside the operator network) shall run in the MF. The FTP client can be implemented in many ways, and here the FTP 
usage is presented with an example only. The FTP client can be implemented by a batch file or a file sender program 

that uses FTP via an API. The login needs to occur only once per e.g. <destaddr> and <leauser> - pair. Once the login is 

done, the files can then be transferred just by repeating "mput" command and checking the transfer status (e.g. from the 

API routine return value). To prevent inactivity timer triggering, a dummy command (e.g. "pwd") can be sent every 

T seconds (T should be less than L, the actual idle time limit). If the number of FTP connections is wanted to be as 
minimized as possible, the FTP file transfer method "B" is to be preferred to the method A (though the method A helps 
more the LEMF by pre-sorting the data sent). 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 105 Simple example of a batch file extract: 
FTP commands usage scenario for transferring a list of files: 

To prevent FTP cmd line buffer overflow the best way is to use wildcarded file names, and let the FTP implementation 
do the file name expansion (instead of shell). The number of files for one mput is not limited this way: 
ftp <flags> <destaddr>  user <leauser> <leapasswd>  cd <destpath>  lcd <srcpath>  bin  mput <files>  nlist <lastfile> <checkfile>  close EOF   This set of commands opens an FTP connection to a LEA site, logs in with a given account (auto-login is disabled), 
transfers a list of files in binary mode, and checks the transfer status in a simplified way. 
Brief descriptions for the FTP commands used in the example: 
user <user-name> <password> Identify the client to the remote FTP server. 
cd <remote-directory> Change the working directory on the remote machine to 
remote-directory. lcd <directory> Change the working directory on the local machine. 
bin Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer 

mput <local-files> Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as 
arguments and do a put for each file in the resulting list. Store each local file on the remote machine. nlist <remote-directory> <local-file> Print a list of the files in a directory on the remote 
machine. Send the output to local-file. close Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return 
to the command interpreter. Any defined macros are erased.  The parameters are as follows: 
<flags>
 contains the FTP command options, e.g. "-i -n -V -p" which equals to "interactive prompting off", "auto-login 
disabled", "verbose mode disabled", and "passive mode enabled". (These are dependent on the used ftp-version.) 
<destaddr>
 contains the IP address or DNS address of the destination (LEA). 
<leauser>
 contains the receiving (LEA) username. 
<leapasswd>
 contains the receiving (LEA) user's password. 
<destpath>
 contains the destination path. 
<srcpath>
 contains the source path. 
<files>
 wild carded file specification (matching the files to be transferred). 
<lastfile>
 the name of the last file to be transferred. 
<checkfile>
 is a (local) file to be checked upon transfer completion; if it exists then the transfer is considered 
successful. 
The FTP application should to do the following things if the check file is not found: 
- keep the failed files; 
- raise "file transfer failure" error condition (i.e. send alarm to the corresponding LEA); 

- the data can be buffered for a time that the buffer size allows. If that would finally be exhausted, DF would 
start dropping the corresponding target's data until the transfer failure is fixed; 
- the transmission of the failed files is retried until the transfer eventually succeeds. Then the DF would again 
start collecting the data; 
- upon successful file transfer the sent files are deleted from the DF. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 106 The FTP server at LEMF shall not allow anonymous login of an FTP client. 
It is required that FTP implementation guarantees that LEMF will start processing data only after data transfer is 
complete. 
The following implementation example addresses a particular issue of FTP implementation. It is important however to 
highlight that there are multiple ways of addressing the problem in question, and therefore the given example does not 

in any way suggest being the default one. 
 MF sends data with a filename, which indicates that the file is temporary. Once data transfer is complete, MF 
renames temporary file into ordinary one (as defined in clause F.3.2.2). 
 The procedure for renaming filename should be as follow: 
1) open FTP channel (if not already open) from MF to LEMF; 

2) sends data to LEMF using command "put" with temporary filename; 
3) after MF finished to send the file, renaming it as ordinary one with command "ren".  
 Brief descriptions for the FTP commands used in the example: 
ren <from-name> <to-name>    renaming filename from-name to to-name. 
 If the ftp-client want to send file to LEMF using the command "mput" (e.g. MF stored many IRI files and want 
to send all together with one command), every filename transferred successfully must be renamed each after 

command "mput" ended. 
F.3.2.4 Exceptional procedures 
Overflow at the receiving end (LEMF) is avoided due to the nature of the protocol. 
In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a reasonably short time period, the local 
buffering at the MF will be sufficient as a delivery reliability backup procedure. 
In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a very long period, the local buffering at the 
MF may have to be terminated. Then the following intercepted data coming from the intercepting nodes towards the MF 

would be discarded, until the transit network or LEMF is up and running again.

 F.3.2.5.2 Information Element syntax 
The dynamic TypeLengthValue (TLV) format is used for its ease of implementation and good encoding and decoding 
performance. Subfield sizes: Type = 2 octets, Length = 2 octets and Value = 0–N octets. From Length the T and L 

subfields are excluded. The Type is different for every different field standardized. 
The octets in the Type and Length subfields are ordered in the little-endian order, (i.e. least significant octet first). Any 
multioctet Value subfield is also to be interpreted as being little-endian ordered (word/double word/long word) when it 

has a (hexadecimal 2/4/8-octet) numeric value, instead of being specified to have an ASCII character string value. This 

means that the least significant octet/word/double word is then sent before the more significant octet/word/double word. 
TLV encoding: 
Type (2 octets)
 Length (2 octets)
 Value (0-N octets)
    ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007

 In figure F.3.1, the TLV structure for GPRS HI3 transfer is presented for the case that there is just one intercepted 
packet inside the CC message. (There can be more CC Header IEs and CC Payload IEs in the CC, if there are more 

intercepted packets in the same CC message.)

CC Information Element
 Figure F.3.1: IE structure of a CC message that contains one intercepted packet 
The first octet of the first TLV element will start right after the last octet of the header of the protocol that is being used
 to carry the CC information. 
The first TLV element (i.e. the main TLV IE) comprises the whole dynamic length CC information, i.e. the dynamic 
length CC header and the dynamic length CC payload. 
Inside the main TLV IE there are at least 2 TLV elements: the Header of the payload and the Payload itself. The Header 
contains all the ancillary IEs related to the intercepted CC packet. The Payload contains the actual intercepted packet. 
There may be more than one intercepted packet in one GPRS HI3 delivery protocol message. If the Value of the main 
TLV IE is longer than the 2 (first) TLV Information Elements inside it, then it is an indication that there are more than 

one intercepted packets inside the main TLV IE (i.e. 4 or more TLV IEs in total). The number of TLV IEs in the main 

TLV IE is always even, since for every intercepted packet there is one TLV IE for header and one TLV IE for payload.

-05) 110 F.3.2.6 Other considerations 
The FTP protocol mode parameters used: 
 transmission mode: stream; 
 format: non-print; 
 structure: file-structure; 
 type: binary. 
The FTP service command to define the file system function at the server side: STORE mode for data transmission. 
The FTP client- (= user - FTP process at the MF) uses e.g. the default standard FTP ports 20 (for data connection) and 
21 (for control connection), "passive" mode is supported. The data transfer process listens the data port for a connection 

from a server-FTP process. 
For the file transfer from the MF to the LEMF(s) e.g. the following data transfer parameters are provided for the FTP 
client (at the MF): 
 transfer destination (IP) address, e.g. "194.89.205.4"; 
 transfer destination username, e.g. "LEA1"; 
 transfer destination directory path, e.g. "/usr/local/LEA1/1234-8291"; 
 transfer destination password; 
 interception file type, e.g. "2" (this is needed only if the file naming method A is used). 
LEMF may use various kind directory structures for the reception of interception files. It is strongly recommended that 
at the LEMF machine the structure and access and modification rights of the storage directories are adjusted to prevent 
unwanted directory operations by a FTP client. 
The use of IPSec services for this interface is recommended. 
Timing considerations for the FTP transmission: 
The MF and LEMF sides control the timers to ensure reliable, near-real time data transfer. The transmission related 
timers are defined within the lower layers of the used protocol and are out of scope of the present document. 
The following timers may be used within the LI application. 
Name 
Controlled by 
Units 
Description 
T1 inactivity timer 
LEMF Seconds 
Triggered by no activity within the FTP session (no new files). 
The FTP session is torn down when the T1 expires. To send 

another file the new connection will be established. The timer 

avoids the FTP session overflow at the LEMF side. 
T2 send file trigger 
MF Milliseconds 
Forces the file to be transmitted to the LEMF (even if the size 
limit has not been reached yet in case of volume trigger active). If 

the timer is set to 0 the only trigger to send the file is the file size 

parameter (see clause C.2.2). 
   ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 111 Annex G (informative): 
LEMF requirements - handling of unrecognized fields and 
parameters 
During decoding of a record at the LEA, the following exceptional situations may occur: 
1) Unrecognized parameter: The parameter layout can be recognized, but its name is not recognized: 
The parameter shall be ignored, the processing of the record proceeds. 
2) The parameter content or value is not recognized or not allowed: 
The parameter shall be ignored, the processing of the record proceeds. 
3) The record cannot be decoded (e.g. it seems to be corrupted): 
The whole record shall be rejected when using ROSE delivery mechanism or ignored. 
NOTE: In cases 2 and 3, the LEMF may wish to raise an alarm to the NWO/AP/SvP administration centre. For 
case 1, no special error or alarm procedures need be started at the LEA because the reason may be the 

introduction of a new version of the specification in the network, not be an error as such security aspects. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 112 Annex H (informative): 
IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) handover 
This annex deals with IRI reporting in the IMS. IRI reporting in multi-media domain specified in this clause does not 
depend on the IP-Connectivity Access Network IP-CAN 3GPP TS 23.228 [70] used to transport the CC. When the 

IP-CAN is the UMTS PS domain, annex B applies for CC interception at the SGSN/GGSN. 
According to 3GPP TS 33.107 [71], interception has to be supported in P-CSCF and S-CSCF. For the identification of 
the intercepted traffic only the SIP-URL and TEL-URL are available. In the intercepting nodes (CSCFs) the relevant 

SIP-Messages are duplicated and forwarded to the MF HI2. 
For clarification see figure H.1. If P-CSCF and S-CSCF are in the same network the events are sent twice to the LEMF.

H.1 Specific identifiers for LI 
Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception uniquely and to correlate between the data, which 
is conveyed over the different handover interfaces (HI2 and HI3). The identifiers are defined in the clauses below. 
For the delivery of CC and IRI the SGSN, GGSN and CSCFs (Call Session Control Function) provide correlation 
numbers and target identities to the HI2 and HI3. The correlation number provided in the PS domain (SGSN, GGSN) is 

unique per PDP context and is used to correlate CC with IRI and the different IRIs of one PDP context. 
Interception is performed on an IMS identifier(s) associated with the intercept subject including identifiers such as 
SIP-URL and Tel-URL, RFC 3966 [68]. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 113 H.1.1 Lawful interception identifier 
For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special 
LIID, which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP). 
Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it easier to keep the knowledge about a specific 
interception target limited within the authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA. 
The LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records. It shall be used within any information 
exchanged at the handover interfaces HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes. 
The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters. It might for example, among other information, contain a 
lawful authorization reference number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued. 
The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall either enter, based on an agreement with each LEA, a unique LIID for each 
target identity of the interception subject or a single LIID for multiple target identities all pertaining to the same 

interception subject. 
Note that, in order to simplify the use of the LIID at LEMF for the purpose of correlating IMS signalling with GSN CC, 
the use of a single LIID in association with potentially numerous IMS identities (SIP and TEL URIs) is recommended. 
If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be unique LIIDs assigned relating to each LEA. 
In case the LIID of a given target has different values in the GSN and in the CSCF, it is up to the LEMF to recover the 
association between the two LIIDs. 
H.1.2 Network identifier 
The network identifier (NID) is a mandatory parameter; it should be internationally unique. It consists of the following 

two identifiers. 
1) Operator- (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory): 
Unique identification of network operator, access network provider or service provider. 
2) Network element identifier NEID (optional): 
The purpose of the network element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element carrying out 
the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending, etc. 
 A network element identifier may be an IP address or other identifier. 
H.1.3 Correlation number 
The GPRS Correlation Number is unique per PDP context and used for the following purposes: 
- correlate CC with GPRS Support Node (GSN) IRI; 

- correlate different GSN IRI records within one PDP context. 
As an example, in the UMTS system, the GPRS Correlation Number may be the combination of GGSN address and 
charging ID. 
NOTE 1: It is an implementation matter how CSCF generates Correlation number value. However, in this release 
CSCF should use gPRSCorrelationNumber ASN.1 parameter as a container. 
If two PDP contexts are used for the communication (one for signalling and one for bearer) also two correlation 
numbers may be delivered via the CSCFs. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 114 Different identifiers may be used for correlating target's various SIP messages such as: 
- LIID; 
- implementation dependent number. 
NOTE 2: The implementation dependent number may be e.g. a "Call-id". However, when CSCF acts as a back-to-
back user agent CSCF can have different "Call-id" values for different legs of signalling. Therefore some 

other number would be needed in such a case. 
NOTE 3: The LIID may be used to associate SIP messages with respective GSN IRI records. In case the target has 
a single SIP session active, the LIID is sufficient to correlate IMS IRI records with GSN IRI records. In 

case the target has multiple SIP sessions active, a combination of the LIID and an 
implementation 
dependent number may be used to correlate the IMS IRI records with the GSN IRI records. 
In case the LIID of a given target has different values in the GSN and in the CSCF, it is up to the LEMF to recover the 
association between the two LIIDs. 
SIP correlation number is used to correlate events of one specific SIP session. 
H.1.4 IRI for IMS 
In addition, information on non-transmission related actions of a target constitute IRI and is sent via HI2,  
e.g. information on subscriber controlled input. 
The IRI may be subdivided into the following categories: 
1) Control information for HI2 (e.g. correlation information). 
2) Basic data context information, for standard data transmission between two parties (e.g. SIP-message). 
For each event, a Record is sent to the LEMF, if this is required. The following table gives the mapping between event 
type received at DF2 level and record type sent to the LEMF. 
Table H.1.1: Mapping between IMS Events and HI2 Records Type 
Event 
IRI Record Type 
SIP-Message REPORT 
 A set of information is used to generate the record. The records used transmit the information from mediation function 
to LEMF. This set of information can be extended in the CSCF or DF2 MF, if new IEs are available and if this is 

necessary in a specific country. The following table gives the mapping between information received per event and 
information sent in records. 
Once IRI only interception is underway, LEMF receives IMS specific IRI only (SIP IRI) from CSCF. LEMF does not 
receive CC, and therefore it is not possible to correlate IMS specific IRI with CC. 
Once IRI and CC interception is underway, LEMF receives IMS specific IRI both from a GSN and from a CSCF. 
LEMF receives SIP messages also from a GSN within CC. In certain cases, however, SIP messages within CC may be 
encrypted between UE and CSCF. In these cases LEMF needs to receive unencrypted SIP IRI straight from CSCF.

NOTE 3: In case of IMS event reporting, the gPRSCorrelationNumber HI2 ASN.1 parameter, which is also used in 
the IRIs coming from PS nodes, is used as container. 
H.1.4.1 Events and information 
This clause describes the information sent from the Delivery Function (DF) to the Law Enforcement Monitoring 

Facility (LEMF) to support Lawfully Authorized Electronic Surveillance (LAES). The information is described as 
records and information carried by a record. This focus is on describing the information being transferred to the LEMF. 
The IRI events and data are encoded into records as defined in the table H.1.1 Mapping between IMS Events and HI2 
Records Type and clause B.3 Intercept related information (HI2). IRI is described in terms of a "causing event" and 

information associated with that event. Within each IRI Record there is a set of events and associated information 

elements to support the particular service. 
The communication events described in table H.1.1: Mapping between the IMS Event and HI2 Record Type and 
table H.1.2: Mapping between IMS Events Information and IRI Information convey the basic information for reporting 
the disposition of a communication. This clause describes those events and supporting information. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 116 Each record described in this clause consists of a set of parameters. Each parameter is either: 
Mandatory (M): required for the record; 

Conditional (C): required in situations where a condition is met (the condition is given in the Description); or 

Optional (O): provided at the discretion of the implementation. 
The information to be carried by each parameter is identified. Both optional and conditional parameters are considered 
to be OPTIONAL syntactically in ASN.1 Stage 3 descriptions. The Stage 2 inclusion takes precedence over Stage 3 
syntax.

 H.1.5 Correlation indications of IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF 
This clause is informative and provides some guidelines pertaining to correlating IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF. 
For IMS-enabled multimedia communication scenarios involving a lawful intercept target, it will be necessary for the 
LEMF to be able to correlate the media streams (as provided in the CC intercepted by the GSN) with the specific SIP 
signalling (as provided in the IRI intercepted by the CSCFs) used to establish those media streams. The principal reason 

for this is that the Session Description Protocol (SDP) content within the SIP signalling may provide the information 

required to even be able to decode the media streams. In certain cases, for example, the information in the RTP header 

within the media stream packets may not be sufficient to be able to determine the specific encoding used. The SDP 

portion of the SIP signalling would need to provide this information. Another important reason is that the SIP signalling 
provides information about the participants in a SIP session (other than the target) sending and receiving the associated 
media streams. The LIID parameter in the IMS IRI and GSN CC can be used to correlating all of the IMS IRI and all of 

the GSN CC associated with a particular target. If a single LIID is used in association all of the target's IMS identities 

(as per a NO/AN/SP agreement with the LEA), the process of associating the IMS IRI and GSN CC information is 

fairly straightforward. If, however, multiple LIIDs are used (e.g. one per IMS identity) then the LEMF needs to be able 

to associate each of the LIIDs that may be used for the IMS IRI with the LIID used for the CC. 
The SIP messages provided to the LEMF would contain a number of additional items of information that could be 
relevant with respect to supporting correlations of various types. Their potential role in correlating IMS IRI and GSN 

CC (or, more specifically, correlating SIP dialogs with media streams) is discussed below: 
 Call-ID, From tag, To tag:
 These SIP headers would identify different SIP messages belonging to the same 
SIP dialog (a call leg between the target user and a peer SIP user). It should be noted that the Call-ID alone is 
not sufficient to identify a dialog. Correlating specific SIP dialogs with specific media streams is the principal 
objective of this discussion. 
 P-Charging-Vector (IMS Charging ID):
 The principal purpose of the IMS Charging ID (ICID) in IMS is to 
correlate charging information provided by different network entities for the same call. The ICID could be 

useful in correlating SIP messages belonging to the same call, even if their SIP dialog identifiers are modified 

(e.g. by a B2BUA application server). It should be noted, however, that the use of the ICID is not necessary 
for the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs and the corresponding media streams. 
  ETSI ETSI ES 201 671 V3.1.1 (2007
-05) 117  P-Charging-Vector (GPRS Charging ID, GGSN address):
 GCIDs, along with the GGSN address, may be 
used as identifiers of the PDP contexts. These identifiers (one for each PDP context used by the SIP session) 

are made available to the P-CSCF and subsequently to the S-CSCF. They could be used to correlate SIP 

messages with the PDP context(s) used. For the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs with media streams, this 

type of correlation would be useful, although not essential. 
 SDP Connection addresses and ports:
 The address and port information within the SDP of the SIP messages 
need to be matched with the addresses and ports corresponding to the media streams as provided in the CC 
reports. This implies a need to look both at the SDP content of the SIP messages as well as in the packets 

provided by the GSN. The set of PDP context identifiers included in the P-Charging-Vector could be used to 

simplify the search for a match. It should also be noted that the SDP contained in the SIP message may also 

include essential information about the encoding of each of the media streams, without which it may not be 
possible to decode.
