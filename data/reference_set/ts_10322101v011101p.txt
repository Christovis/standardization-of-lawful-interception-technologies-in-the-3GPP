Foreword This Technical Specification (TS) ha
s been produced by ETSI Technical
 Committee Lawful Interception (LI). 
The present document is part 1 of a multi-part deliverab
le covering the Internal Network Interfaces for Lawful 
Interception (LI), as identified below: 
Part 1: "X1"; 
Part 2: "X2/X3".

-03)7 1 Scope 
The present document defines an electr
onic interface for the exchange of inform
ation relating to the establishment and 
management of Lawful Interception. Typically, this inte
rface would be used between a central LI administration 
function and the network internal interception points. 
Typical reference models for LI define an interface be
tween Law Enforcement Agenci
es (LEAs) and Communication 
Service Providers (CSPs), called the handover interface. They also define an internal ne
twork interface within the CSP 
domain between administration and mediation functions for la
wful interception and network internal functions, which 
facilitates the interception of communication. This internal network interface typically consists of three sub-interfaces; 
administration (called X1), transmission of intercept related information (X2) and transmission of content of 

communication (X3). The present document sp
ecifies the administration interface X1.

4.1 Reference model 
4.1.1 Overview 
The X1 interface is based on communication between two entities; the controlling function (e.g. a CSP ADMinistration 
Function (ADMF)), and the controlled function (e.g. a Network Element or Network Function (the terms are equivalent) 

performing interception or mediation and delivery). The X1 reference model is shown in figure 1. 
Controlled Function
Controlling Function
X1 Figure 1: X1 reference model 
While the present document uses the terms Network Element (NE), the term is intended to represent any given Network 

Function (NF) which is intended to be given information re
garding interception or mediation and delivery. Similarly, 
the term "ADMF" is intended to represent any given networ
k function that controls interception or mediation and 
delivery in other functions. 
4.1.2 ADMF deployment model 
Figure 2 shows a deployment model for X1 where a CSP ADMF uses X1 to provision a number of NEs to perform 

interception.

X1X1X1X1 Figure 2: X1 reference model 
Only one ADMF shall make changes by X1 to a given NE. This is called the ADMF which is "responsible" for that NE. 
Onward delivery of information from the NE is called X2 (for xIRI) and X3 (for xCC). X2 and X3 are defined in ETSI 
TS 103 221-2 [19]. 
Some deployments may involve multiple ADMFs for redundancy or other purposes; where multiple ADMFs are 
required, the NE shall be implemented such that 
it presents itself as a separate NE to each ADMF. 
ADMF and NE shall implement time synchronization where possible; in situations where it is not possible, the ADMF 

shall maintain knowledge of the timing offset between the ADMF and NE. 
NOTE: The present document may be used in direct delive
ry scenarios, in which the NE delivers directly to the 
LEMF. Any consequences of using direct delivery are out of scope of the present document.

Figure 3 shows another possible deployment model for X1, where the X1 protocol is used to trigger interception by one 
in a second network function. In this deployment model, th
e "Triggering Function" takes on the role of the ADMF in 

the previous deployment model, while the "Triggered Function" takes on the role of the NE.

If this deployment model is used, then in the following clauses references to the ADMF should be interpreted as 
applying to the Triggering Function, while references to the NE should be interpreted as references to the Triggered 
Function. 
4.1.4 Mediation and delivery function deployment model 
Figure 4 shows another possible deployment model for X1, where the X1 protocol is used to manage a CSP mediation 

and delivery function. In this deployment model, the MDF takes on the role of the NE in the previous deployment 

model.

If this deployment model is used, then in the following clause
s references to the NE should be interpreted as applying to 
the MDF. 
4.2 Reference model for X1: requesting and responding 
X1 transactions consist of a request followed by a response. 
Requests may be sent in either direction i.e. with the ADM
F or NE initiating the request. The side initiating the request 
is called the "Requester"; this term is
 used when it is not specified whether it is the ADMF or NE making the request. 
The other side is called the "Responder".

ADMF or NE)

 Figure 5: Showing generic terminology 
It is likely that in most situations, the ADMF will initiate the message i.e. to distribute information or request status. 
However, it is possible that the NE will initiate the request in order to deliver fault reports, etc.

4.3 Overview of security 
Security is based on creating public/private keys for 
the ADMF and each NE for which it is responsible. All 
transactions over X1 are performed using the security procedures in clause 8, which provide assurance that 
communication only takes place between an NE and ADMF which have been populated with the relevant key material. 
NE implementers are strongly discouraged from exposing additional interfaces for controlling the LI functionality of the 
NE other than by X1 e.g. via a local administrative interface at the NE. If such additional interfaces exist, any such 
action performed on the NE shall be captured on the NE aud
it/logging, and any consequences of such actions shall be 
able to be seen and controlled by the ADMF that is responsible for the NE i.e. the ADMF shall be able to use the X1 
interface to stop or undo any changes made over a local ad
ministrative interface. There may be broader consequences 

that are not covered by the present document if an NE is
 tasked independently of the X1 interface (e.g. security 
concerns). 
4.4 Relationship to other standards 
The present document forms part of a fa
mily of internal interface documents c
overing all of X1, X2 and X3 which are 
handled as separate standards. 
Some models of LI (e.g. 3GPP TS 33.107 [1], 3GPP TS 33.127 [22]) define interfaces for the purposes described in 
clause 4.1, (e.g. X1_1, X1_2 and X1_3 defined by 3GPP TS 33.107 [1] or LI_X1 defined by 3GPP TS 33.127 [22]). 

The present document is designed to fu
lfil the requirements for those interfaces. 
4.5 Release management 
This clause describes the release manageme
nt requirements. The requirements are: 
• The version of the present document is defined as <major>.<minor>.<patch>. 
• The major version should be incremented wh
en making a backwards incompatible change. 
• The minor version should be incremented when adding backwards compatible functionality. 
• The patch version should be incremented when fixing a backwards compatible bug. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)14 Once a major version has been incremente
d, the previous major version will be 
supported for 2 years after publication 
of the new version. Change requests issued
 to a version that is no longer supported 
will need to be issued for the latest 
supported major version. 
5 Basic concepts 
5.1 The lifecycle of a Task 
5.1.1 Start and end of a Task 
A Task relates to a single target identifier, and goes from the point an ActivateTask Request is sent by the ADMF to the 
time a DeactivateTask Request is sent by the ADMF, a "t
erminating fault" occurs, or (for Tasks with the 
"ImplicitDeactivationAllowed" flag set) the NE determines that it has completed. 
The present document does not define which situations are categorized as "terminating faults". Local recovery 
procedures should be followed before a Task is ended with a 
"terminating fault". In general, irrecoverable failures with 
an interception, or major security issues at an NE should be considered terminating faults, and certain outcomes with 
keepalives are also term
inating faults (where defined in clause 6.6.2). 
5.1.2 Identification of a Task 
Each Task on X1 is uniquely identified by an X1 Identifier (XID) and it is handled independently of all others. The 

ADMF shall assign the XID as a version 4 UUID as per IETF RFC 4122 [2]. The ADMF is responsible for correlating 

the XID to any LI instance identifiers 
used to communicate with Law Enforcem
ent. When used between the ADMF and 
the MDF, the entire LI system may support one of several possibilities: 
1) an XID may only map to a single LIID; or 
2) an XID may map to multiple LIIDs. 
In the first case, each intercept is separately provisioned for 
a target ID at a given POI. In either case, the ADMF shall 
provide the XID to LIID(s) mapping to the MDF. 
In addition, the XID is released once the Task has ended. 
5.1.3 Destinations 
Intercepted traffic is delivered by the NE to a Destinati
on. Each Destination is uniquely identified by a Destination 
Identifier (DID), and is handled independently from details of
 the Task. DIDs can optionally be grouped with individual 
DID preference weightings as part of a Destination Set. Destination Sets specify an action, which defines how DIDs 
within the Destination Set are used; Destination Sets are 
uniquely identified by their Generic Object ID, which is 
referred to as the Destination Set Identifier (DSID) (see annex E). 
Each Task is associated with one or more Destinations or 
Destination Sets. Prior to associating a Task with a given DID 
or DSID, it is required that a Destination with the DID, or 
Destination Set with the DSID 
has already been created (as 
described in clauses 6.3 and annex E) but there is no require
ment that a connection has been successfully established for 
that DID or DSID. 

Checks regarding availability and status of downstream delivery of information are outside the scope of the present 
document. 
5.1.4 Generic Objects 
The NE may require supplementary information which is not described within the Task or Destination objects. Such 

information is contained within structures derived from
 a Generic Object, which may be managed via the messages 
defined in clause 6.8. Generic Object are defined in clause 6.8.1.2. This mechanism shall only be used for the 

implementation of objects that are defined and standardized in the present document. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 
221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)15 5.2 The lifecycle of an X1 request/response 
5.2.1 Identification of
 X1 request/response 
Each request and response shall be identified by an X1Tr
ansactionID. The requester (may be ADMF or NE) shall assign 
an X1TransactionID as a version 4 UUID as per IETF RFC 4122 [2]. 
5.2.2 Responding to the request 
The response shall be sent without undue 
delay and shall be sent within TIME1 
of receiving the request. TIME1 shall 
be configurable and by default TIME1 sha
ll be five seconds. TIME2, the time a requester waits for a response, shall be 
configurable, it shall be at least twice TIME1 and by default shall be fifteen seconds. 
An error response shall be sent if the request is not 
compliant syntactically (it does not match the schema) or 
semantically (it is not compliant or consistent with the 
existing state of the NE e.g. activating an existing XID). 
If the request is compliant, one of the following responses shall be sent: 
• "OK - Acknowledged and Completed" response shall be sent if the request is fully understood, compliant and 
the request has been successfully completed. If the request was a request for information then all the 

information shall be delivered together as part of 
the "OK - Acknowledged and Completed" response. The NE 
and ADMF shall be designed so that information requested (status and Task information) is in a data store 

which is readily available without undue delay and within TIME1. 
• If the action requested cannot be completed within TIME
1, an "OK - Acknowledged" response shall be sent. 
A status report shall be sent by the NE as soon as the action is completed or if it is unsuccessful (see 

clause 6.5.2.2). This status report shall be sent as a new request/response pair, using the same XID or DID but 

the status report shall have its own X1TransactionID. The "OK - Acknowledged" response shall only be used 

for responding to requests which are Activating, Modifying or Deleting either Tasks or Destinations (those in 

clauses 6.2 and 6.3) and they shall not be
 used to respond to other request types. 
5.2.3 Behaviour if a response is not received 
If the requester has not received a response after TIME2 (as de
fined in clause 5.2.2), or if a status report on the 
completion of the whole request followi
ng an "OK - Acknowledge" has not been received in a timely fashion, the 
requester may assume that either the request or response fail
ed to get through. For example, the requester may consider 
requesting the status of the XID in question to see whether the prior request has been actioned (e.g. ActivateTask, 
ModifyTask, DeactivateTask or DeactivateAllTasks) or the 
requester may re-send the original request (as a new 
request, with a new X1TransactionID). 
5.3 Warnings and Faults 
The present document uses the term "error" to mean a protocol error within the X1 protocol as defined in clause 6.7. 
All other problems are categorized as warnings or faults: 
• Warnings are one-off problems i.e. sent by the NE and then not referred to again over X1. Warnings shall not 
be used for issues which are affecting traffic (i.e. losing content or intercept-related information). For example, 
warnings may include resources being nearly exhausted 
but not yet traffic-affecting. Warnings should include 
that keys/certificates are about to expire. 
• Faults are problems which the NE will continue to be aware of and which the NE is trying to manage and/or 

rectify. Any issue which loses tra
ffic is categorized as a fault. 
Warnings are reported using issue-reporting messages (clause 6.
5) but then are not included in any future Status-Getting 
messages (see clause 6.4). The NE shall log any warnings for audit reasons. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)16 The NE shall remember which of the XIDs 
are in fault and whether the NE itself is in a fault situation. An issue report 
(see clause 6.5) is required at the star
t of the fault. The NE shall report faults when responding to the Status-Getting 
message defined in clause 6.4. The NE shall also indicate 
that a fault has been cleared (see clauses 6.5.2 and 6.5.3) 
unless otherwise configured.

C  In addition to the information in table 1, the X1 Request shall indicate the type of request being made (see clauses 6.2 to 
6.6), and contain the appropriate request parameters for that type of request. 
If the X1 Request could not be parsed, then the response shall be constructed with an ADMF and NE Identifier 
(extracting the identifier of the Requester from the X.509 cer
tificate if necessary), MessageTimestamp and Version, and 
a "TopLevelError" flag but no other information. 
If the request could be parsed then the response shall indicat
e the type of response being returned (see clauses 6.2 to 
6.6) and contain the appropriate response parameters for that type of response. 
A "RequestContainer" is used to contain one or more requ
ests. All requests in a container are delivered at the same 
time, from the same Requester and to the same Responder. There is no implication about which order they are 
processed; for this reason, the ADMF should avoid sending 
ActivateTask and ModifyTask messages for the same XID 
in the same RequestContainer. A "ResponseContainer" is used to contain all the responses to the requests in the 

container. The ordering of these responses does not have a meaning. All responses are sent at the same time, from the 

same Responder and to the same Requester. The RequestContaine
r and ResponseContainer shall be used even if there is 
one request and one response. 
For each "OK - Acknowledged" response received for the reque
sts transported by a "RequestContainer", the requester 
should implement logic to assure the re
lated status report is received and the 
transaction is completed or initiate a 
recovery procedure.

If a Task has a ServiceType not supported by the NE, then the NE shall reject the ActivateTaskRequest with an 
appropriate error. If the expected servi
ces to which interception applies are the only services that an NE provides, then 
inclusion of ServiceType to the LI function in that NE is not necessary. If the ServiceType is not included, then 
interception applies to all services supported by the NE.

 6.5 Message details: reporting issues from the NE 
6.5.1 Overview 
This clause defines request types for the NE to report issues
 to the ADMF. It is distinct from "Getting Status", in which 
the ADMF retrieves information fr
om the NE (see clause 6.4). 
Issues may be: 
• Relating to a particular XID (including delivery issues with that XID). 
• Relating to a particular DID. 
• Relating to the whole NE. 
6.5.2 ReportT
askIssue on given XID 
6.5.2.1 Summary 
DIRECTION: NE to ADMF. 
USAGE: The NE shall send a ReportTaskIssue request when 
it becomes aware of an issue (warning or fault) 
relating specifically to a particular XID. It 
shall also be used to follow up on an 
"OK - Acknowledged" response, to signal that a request has been completed (clause 5.2) 
successfully or unsuccessfully. 
Faults and warnings are defined in clause 5.3; see also clause 5.1 about terminating and non-terminating faults. 
If a non-terminating fault becomes terminating, the NE shall send another ReportTaskIssue. 

If a non-terminating fault is cleared, the NE shall send
 another ReportTaskIssue indicating the fault is cleared.

an error back to the NE in this situation: it is for th
e ADMF to decide how to handle this (e.g. GetAllDetails or 
Deactivate the XID in question are possible approaches). 
6.5.2.2 Task report types 
The TaskReportType shall be one of the following: 
• All clear: non-terminating fault resolved. 
• Warning: not traffic-affecting. 
• Non-terminating fault (currently unable to collect traffic but not terminating). 
• Terminating fault. The message is used by the NE to indicate that the Task has experiences a terminating fault 
and has been deactivated. 
• Implicit Deactivation: A Task w
ith the "ImplicitDeactivationAllowed" flag ha
s been deactivated. 
• Actioned: Request has been fully actioned and wa
s successful (to follow up on "OK - Acknowledged" 
response from clause 5.2). 
• Failed: Request has been fully actioned but was unsuccessful (to follow up on "OK - Acknowledged" response 

from clause 5.2). This is a terminating fault. 
6.5.3 ReportDestinationIssue on given DID 
6.5.3.1 Summary 
DIRECTION: NE to ADMF. 
USAGE: The NE shall send a ReportDestinationIssue reque
st when it becomes aware of an issue (warning 
or fault) relating specifically to a particular DID. It shall also be used to follow up on an 
"OK - Acknowledged" response, to signal that a request has been completed (clause 5.2) 

successfully or unsuccessfully. 
Faults and warnings are defined in clause 5.3; see also clause 5.1 about terminating and non-terminating faults. 
If a non-terminating fault becomes terminating, the NE shall send another ReportDestinationIssue. 
If a non-terminating fault is cleared, the NE shall send another ReportDestinationIssue indicating the fault is cleared.

 The Keepalive functionality shall be supported by NE and ADMF. It is for prior agreement to determine whether 
Keepalives are enabled or disabled. By default (with no prior 
agreement) they are 
enabled. It is intended as a means for 
the NE application to assert that the ADMF application is still operational, and remove all tasking information as a 

security measure if it is not. 
If Keepalives are enabled, the ADMF sh
all send out a Keepalive message at least every TIME_P1 (by default TIME_P1 
is 1 minute) if no other X1 request has been sent to the NE. 

If Keepalives are enabled, the NE sha
ll respond with an OK for each Keepalive; 
if the NE has not seen a Keepalive 
message for TIME_P2 (by default TIME_P2 is 1 hour) th
en the NE shall perform a DeactivateAllTasks command 
i.e. deactivate all XIDs on the NE. The 
NE implementation shall reset the timer 
whenever any X1 Request is received 
from the ADMF (including a Keepalive Request).

7 Transport and Encoding 
7.1 Introduction 
The present document defines a single profile for transport and encoding of X1 messages. 
7.2 Profile A 
7.2.1 Encoding 
XML encoding shall be used. An XSD schema is provi
ded contained in archive ts_10322101v011101p0.zip which 
accompanies the present document.
 In the event of a discrepancy between 
the XSD schema and the present document, 
the present document shall be considered authoritative. 
The attached samples provide an inform
ative example for implementations of th
e present document. The samples do not 
form part of the normative specification. 

The attached tool "validate_
examples.py" allows implementers to valid
ate the XSD against th
e attached examples. 
7.2.2 Transport layer 
7.2.2.1 HTTPS and HTTP 
HTTPS shall be used as per IETF RFC 2818 [12]. The details relating to HTTP are given in this clause and the details 
relating to TLS are specified in clause 8.2. 
In this clause, the term HTTP is used (it is implicit that 
it is in fact HTTPS i.e. that the HTTP is used over TLS). 
7.2.2.2 How HTTP is used 
The ADMF and NE shall both run HTTP clients and servers: 
• For messages where the ADMF is the re
quester, the ADMF shall use its HTTP client and the NE shall use its 
HTTP server. 
• For messages where the NE is the requester, the NE sh
all use its HTTP client and the ADMF shall use its 
HTTP server. 
Details in the request: 
• Each "RequestContainer" shall be sent as a HTTP reque
st. It shall be a "POST" message (regardless of which 
type of X1 request it is) and the message body shall cont
ain the RequestContainer as described in clause 6. 
Details in the response: 
• Each "ResponseContainer" message shall be sent as a HTTP response. 
• The response shall indicate HTTP level errors within the range of HTTP error codes. If the HTTP level 

transaction is successful, then the response shall be a 200 OK message, with the ResponseContainer contained 

within the message body. 
• HTTP error codes shall only be used 
to indicate HTTP-level e
rrors, and shall not be used to indicate errors 
with the X1 responses themselves. X1-level errors shall be indicated by correct use of the appropriate X1 

ErrorResponse, encoded and returned as a HTTP 200 OK response. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)36 7.2.2.3 Profile 
The following profile shall be used: 
HTTP version 1.1 or HTTP/2 shall be used. ADMF implementations shall support both. 

Where used, HTTP version 1.1 shall be used as per IETF RFC 7230 [13] and related specifications. 
NOTE: HTTP/1.1 defaults to the use of "persistent connections" (see IETF RFC 7230 [13], section 6.3). 
Implementers are encouraged to support the use of persistent connections. 
Where used, HTTP/2 shall be used as per IETF RFC 7540 [21] and related specifications. 
HTTP/1.1 Pipelining shall not be used. 
A Requester may issue multiple HTTP requests in parallel over multiple HTTP connections or multiplexed HTTP/2 
requests. However, such implementations should be aware that there is no guarantee of the order in which these 

requests are processed by the Responder. If such ordering is important to the Requester, it is responsible for ensuring 
the requests are sent out in the correct order, and for waiting for the response to each request before issuing the next 
one. Transfer Coding shall not be applied to the HTTP Request or Response (see IETF RFC 7230 [13], section 4). 
By default, port 443 shall be used. If this is already in use, then the NE and ADMF shall be able to be configured with a 
port number, which shall be agreed
 prior to use of the standard. 
By default, the ADMF shall send the HTTP requests with th
e path set to "/X1/NE" and the NE shall send the HTTP 
requests with the path set to "/X1/ADMF". An exception to the default shall only be made with strict agreement 
between NE and ADMF; however, implementers shall ensure 
that an X1 implementation 
can be configured with a 
different path if required. 
8 Security 
8.1 Overview 
This clause details security 
measures to be implemented for the X1 interf
ace. Other security aspects related to the NE 
(e.g. secure storage of information, access contro
l) are out of scope of the present document. 
8.2 Transport Security 
8.2.1 Summary 
TLS shall be used which provides authentication and authorization, integrity and confidentiality as well as replay 
protection between the TLS endpoints. 
8.2.2 Profile 
TLS shall be followed, using at least version 1.2 as defined in IETF RFC 5246 [14], supporting the recommendations 

given in IETF RFC 7525 [16]. 
New implementations should support TLS 1.3 as defined in IETF RFC 8446 [20]. 
8.2.3 Key generation, deployment and storage 
Apart from requirements given in clauses 8.2.1, 8.2.2 and 8.2.
4, aspects concerning the generation, distribution, storage 
and revocation of key material and cer
tificates are out of scope of the present document. Implementations are 
encouraged to support best practice e.g. the guidance 
given in OWASP TLS Cheat Sheet [i.1], section 2.6. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)37 NOTE: It is assumed that the NE and ADMF are in a physically secure environment. For future uses (e.g. NFV), 
then this assumption would no longer be valid. Furthe
r details would then need to be added about the 
security of storage of key or certificate material e.g. TPM, Secure enclaves. See ETSI TR 103 308 [i.2], 
ETSI GS NFV-SEC 009 [i.3] and ETSI GS NFV-SEC 012 [i.4]. 
8.2.4 Authentication 
Implementations shall perform mutual authentication using X.509 certificates following IETF RFC 6125 [17]. 

Implementations shall ensure that it is 
configurable which certificates are used. 
X1 implementations shall check that the UID relative distinguished name (OID 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1) of the 

Subject field in the certificate (see 
IETF RFC 4519 [18] section 2.39) provide
d matches the Sender or Receiver ID 
(whichever is provided by the other pa
rty in the communication). If a Responde
r receives an X1 message where these 
values do not match, it shall respond with an X1 error message indicating that the Requester is not authorized. If the 

Requester receives a response where these values do not ma
tch, then it shall disregard the response and log an 
appropriate error message. 
8.3 Additional security measur
es (beyond transport layer) 
It will be important to follow general security best practice (e.g. use of firewalls and/or access lists to prevent 
denial-of-service attacks). This is out of scope of the 
present document. However, im
plementers are specifically 
encouraged to follow XML best practices outlined in the OWASP XML Security Cheat Sheet [i.5]. 
The present document does not recommend that message-lay
er encryption or message-lev
el message authentication 
codes are used in addition to the provisions in this clause. Of course, there may be threat models in which additional 
encryption may be thought to be useful. The present document does not forbid adding message-layer encryption e.g. by 

encrypting the whole of the payloads of the request and resp
onse messages. The details of the changes needed to do this 
are outside the scope of the present document.  
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)38 Annex A (normative): 
Requirements 
A.1 Basic requirements 
A.1.1 Existing standards 
The interface should use already existing me
chanisms and standards if possible. 
R1) Future proof: 
Changes can be made and new features can be
 added. A version structure will allow for 
co-existence of different versions. 
R2) Open structure:
 The interface will have an open structure th
at will allow for extensions. Though it should be 
as strict as possible to make implementations as interoperable as possible. Extensions should not have any 
negative impact on security and other requirements. 
R3) Security: Authentication, integrity prot
ection and confidentiality shall be supported from end to end. 
R4) Authenticity:
 The authenticity of a message can be checked 
in a standalone environment (e.g. no connection 
to an online server 
needed, root certificate can be enough). 
R5) Legal framework:
 The present document contains a technical specification which is independent of national 
legislation. It does not supersede nati
onal legislation or approved practices.  
R6) Direct delivery:
 Some network elements suppo
rt direct delivery of IRI 
and CC without any additional 
mediation and delivery function. The interface should also suppo
rt administration of th
ese network elements. 
R7) Core functionality: 
It shall be possible to provision (create, modify and delete) interceptions including all 
necessary parameters (e.g. CC/IRI-destination) on network 
nodes. It shall be possible to retrieve details of a 
single or all interceptions provisioned on a network node. 
R8) Administration:
 It shall be possible to administrate LI rele
vant configuration on network nodes (e.g. update 
of security certificates). 
A.2 Protocol & Architecture requirements 
The following protocol and archit
ecture requirements are listed: 
R9) Node Scope: 
The X1 architecture and protocol shall support administration of all nodes involved in capture 
and control of target intercept traffic including inte
rcept nodes and mediation and delivery functions. This 
shall include both on-switch and off switch probe scenarios. 
R10) Basic functionality: 
The basic message exchange protocol shall be able to carry both generic LI parameters 
(e.g. those obtained from X1 E-warrant interface) and 
Interception Node manufact
urer specific parameters. 
R11) Extensible: 
The basic message exchange protocol shall allow limited extensibility to support parameter not 
currently supported by the base protoc
ol. This extensibility shall be limited
 to encourage future extension of 
the standardized basic functionality in future versions of the X1 standard. 
R12) Flexibility: 
The X1 architecture and message exchange techni
que shall be flexible to allow implementation 
in both existing and future national and international 
operator network architectures. As a minimum it shall 
be compatible with 3GPP, TISPAN/NTECH, NFV SEC, ETSI TC LI, ANSI and other international network 

architecture and handover standards. 
R13) One-to-many: 
The architecture and message protocol shall support both one-to-one and one-to-many LI end 
point configurations (i.e. it shall be possible to provision hundreds of end points simultaneously and 

efficiently). 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 
221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)39 R14) Backwards compatibility: 
The X1 architecture and protocol shall be
 backwards compatible
 with existing LI 
devices where possible. Specifically 
the standardized X1 shall not pl
ace significantly more performance or 
load impacts than existing proprietary approaches on LI nodes. 
 There is no specific requirement to retro-fit this X1 standards onto existing IP or legacy circuit switched 
nodes, although the standards does not prohibit such retrofitting where practical. Parallel running of X1 and 
legacy or proprietary interfaces shall be supported where practical. The X1 architecture shall permit different 
versions of X1 to be running on 
different components and (as far as is
 practical) the functionality from the 
older version shall still continue to wo
rk (though features introduced in the new versions shall cause errors to 

be sent). 
R15) Lightweight: 
Many LI devices (e.g. Switches/Routers) currently use lightweight protocols such as SNMP, 
and have limited processing power and/or limited application layer intelligence. The protocol shall be 

designed to support such lightweight devices. 
R16) Permanent and 
dynamic connections: 
The X1 architecture and message exchange technique shall support 
both permanent connection and dynamic link/connection scenarios. 
R17) Direct delivery:
 Support situation where interception is delivered direct to LEMF without further CSP 
mediation. No need to explicitly draw this out but do allow enough information over X1 to support this 

situation.  
R18) Delay: 
The X1 architecture and message exchange technique shall by design not introduce undue delay 
compared with existing proprietary X1 implementations. 
R19) Dynamic Triggering and HI1: 
The X1 architecture and message excha
nge technique shall be compatible 
and interoperable with both ETSI TC LI HI1 and Dynamic Triggering standards. 
A.3 Security requirements 
R20) Authentication: 
The X1 architecture and message exchange t
echnique shall provide both authentication of 
physical end points and authenti
cation of the software appli
cation receiving the message. 
NOTE: Requirement is limited to authenticating the LI function identity and not authenticating the software 
version or integrity. 
R21) Authorization: 
The X1 architecture and message exchange technique shall provide both authorization of 
physical end points and authori
zation of the software applic
ation receiving the message. 
R22) Accounting and audit: 
The X1 architecture and message excha
nge technique shall include sufficient 
information to enable Accounting & Auditing functions in the ADMF and NE. 
R23) Integrity protection: 
The X1 message exchange technique shall pr
ovide integrity protection for all messages 
exchanged between nodes in the X1 architecture. Use of Integrity protection shall be mandatory. 
R24) Confidentiality protection:
 The X1 message exchange technique shall provide confidentiality protection for 
all messages exchanged between nodes in the X1 architecture. 
R25) Replay protection: 
The X1 message exchange technique shall 
provide replay protection for all messages 
exchanged between nodes in the X1 architecture. 
R26) Standalone interface:
 The X1 architecture and message exchange technique shall be designed as a 
standalone physically dedi
cated LI interface. The design and selecti
on of the protocol shall where possible 
ensure vulnerabilities in non-LI interfaces on the same node shall not impact LI interfaces and security. 
R27) Hardened Protocol:
 The X1 message exchange technique shall use a harden protocol containing minimal 
options or extensions which are not specifically required by X1. 
R28) Minimum Security Level:
 The X1 architecture and me
ssage exchange techniques shall provide a minimum 
level of security (including cypher suites and key leng
th), which shall be supported by all nodes. At least 

two algorithms shall be specified. The protocol and algorithms shall be resistant to bid down attack. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)40 R29) Underlying Infrastructure Trust:
 The X1 architecture and message ex
change techniques shall assume by 
default that the underlying network communication links and infrastructure are untrusted. 
R30) Firewall and NAT Transversal: 
The X1 message exchange technique 
shall be compatible with existing 
operator firewall and NAT transversal architectures. 
The message exchange technique shall not require 
unrestricted opening of common ports (e.g. port 80 or 21). The message exchange technique shall not 
prohibit the development of future X1 aware firewall filtering to provide rejection of malicious X1 message 
at operator security gateways. 
R31) Certificate and Key Management:
 The X1 architecture and message exchange techniques shall include 
(where applicable) Certificate and Key Manage
ment mechanisms. In addition mechanisms for 
Certificate/Key revocation shall be provided. 
R32) Single Node Compromise:
 The X1 architecture and message exchan
ge techniques shall ensure that a 
vulnerability or weak implementation in one node does 
not adversely affect
 other nodes. Specifically it shall 
not be possible to attack one interception node by using re
covered plan text or other security parameters from 
a vulnerable one. 
R33) Node Administration:
 The X1 architecture and message exchange
 techniques shall ensure by design that 
within node implementations, non-LI super-users can be prevented from making LI related parameters 

changes without authority from and knowledge of the LI administrator. 
R34) Encryption of 
target information:
 It shall be possible to use encrypted target information only by use of 
encrypted targets and encryption keys. In case of en
crypted information it shall be possible to change 
encrypted target information and encryption keys periodically without interruption of any active interception. 
A.4 Other requirements 
A.4.1 Performance statistics (For Further Study) 
Performance requirements include: 
• In general or per LI measure. 
• Activity: Amount of intercepted traffic? Maximum and 
average bandwidth? Minutes
 of intercepted voice? 
Count of intercepted messages? Time of last activity? 
• Maximum number of parallel interceptions (e.g. in busy hours). 
• Maximum number of parallel intercepted accounts/connecti
ons with same target id
entifier (e.g. in case of 
IMEI duplicates). 
The performance requirements are derived from measures of th
e amount and rate of Lawful Interception. Clearly this 
will vary but some guidelines are as follows: 
• Considerations of the bandwidth of intercepted traffic are in general not relevant to X1 (except perhaps for a 

NE to report that bandwidth is
 exceeding certain parameters). 
• Number of targets on cover at any given time: 
- This number is usually very small compared to the total number of users and for the purposes of the 
present document will be considered as tens or hundreds at most. 
• Are there situations where a single ta
rget on cover causes a lot of X1 me
ssages. Consider the following ways 
this could happen: 
- Can a single target cause a large number of target
 identifiers to be tasked (consider roaming)? 
- Can one have a large number of HI1 messages fo
r each target identifier (frequent changing of 
parameters)? 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)41 - For a single ADMF-NE link, can one have lots of X1 messages for a given HI1 message arriving at the 
ADMF? 
- How many different NEs can each ADMF have to talk to? 
A.4.2 Capability detection 
Automatic capability detection is not covered in the present document. 
A.4.3 Remote triggering  
Remote triggering is defined as a system where a trustworthy node contains the target list. Instead of maintaining a list 

of intercepted targets on a (less trustworthy) network node, the start of all communication (calls, data session, etc.) 

could be reported to another (trustworthy) node which checks for intercepted targets and dynamically triggers 

interceptions on the first node. 
Remote triggering is not covered in the present document. 
A.4.4 Requirements to be handled by the transport layer 
R35)
 Ability to send frequent messages from ADMF to NE
 to add/delete, with an OK/not OK response. 
R36)
 Ability to send frequent list messages, with a status update response. 
R37)
 Ability to send occasional urgent messages from NE 
as error messages, with a "received OK" response. 
R38)
 Reliable transport - need to know if message failed to get through. 
R39)
 Able to be secured using standard techniques. Discuss whether there are concerns about what has to be 
opened in various firewalls to let it through. 
R40)
 Simple and lightweight, suitable for use on standa
rd network equipment in broadband (e.g. router) and 
mobile communications (e.g. SGSN). 
R41)
 Helpful (non-essential) if it is able to group multiple messages together so that one security check is not 
needed for each message (this can be handled by a grouping function within our message layer though nicer 
not to). 
R42)
 No unnecessary buffering or delays of some messages compared to others, though perhaps does not need to 
guarantee the order of delivery of messages. 
R43)
 No QoS - the interface will not prioritize or buffer any information. Needs to deliver messages to end point, 
which can either accept the message (and buffer/prioritize if it chooses) or reject. 
R44)
 Every message requires a response:

Use of extensions 
B.1 Overview 
The present document defines a number of extension points, including in the TaskDetails structure (see clause 6.2.1.2), 
and TargetIdentifier format (see table 5). This clause defines how extensions are to be used in table 4 and table 5. 
B.2 Extension definitions 
Where a feature or information element al
ready exists in the present document, it
 shall be used in preference to any 
extended field. Extensions shall not be drafted as an alternative or re-formatting of functionality or information that 

already exists within the present document. 
An extension shall be a structure (e.g. a complexType in XS
D) defined in a separate schema, and shall contain at a 
minimum the following elements.

Using Task Object at Mediation and Delivery Functions 
C.1 Overview 
An ADMF may use X1 messages to provision a mediation a
nd delivery function instead of a point of interception, 
following the deployment model given in clause 4.1.4. 
This annex describes how the usage and meaning of the 
messages defined in clause 6 differ when used for this purp
ose. Unless otherwise specified, the messages are used as for 
any other NE. 
C.2 TaskDetails 
C.2.1 General 
The TaskDetails structure used in th
e ActivateTask and ModifyTask messages are used as for an NE with the 
differences described in the following clauses. 
C.2.2 MediationDetails structure 
The MediationDetails structure provides additional details 
for a Task, specific to Mediation and Delivery Functions. 
Multiple instances of the MediationDetails structure may be used to indicate that multiple LIIDs are associated with the 
task. 
When a ModifyTask message is received by the MDF from 
the ADMF, the MDF shall, upon successful processing and 
execution of the ModifyTask message, ensure that: 
1) only the LIIDs included in the ModifyTask message (via a MediationDetails structure) remain active; and 
2) any LIIDs that were associated with the task identified in the ModifyTask message, but were not identified in 
the ModifyTask message, shall be deactivat
ed (i.e. those intercepts shall cease). 
To clarify the above, suppose that TaskID A had LIID 4 an
d LIID 5 associated with it 
and interception was active on 
both LIID 4 and LIID 5. If a Modify
Task message is received and successfully processed by the MDF with a single 
MediationDetails structure that includes LIID 4, then the interception on LIID 4 will remain active while the 

interception on LIID 5 will cease.

-03)45 Annex D (normative): 
Hashed Identifiers D.1 Overview 
Hashed identifiers provide an alternative to providing plain-text target identifiers over X1. This is intended to provide a 
measure of additional security against disclosure of such target identifiers. However, it should be noted that this 

technique does not provide protection against: 
• An attacker in possession of hash information from verifying whether a specific given identifier matches a 

given hash or salt. 
• An attacker in possession of complete hash information (including salt) from recovering identifiers that have a 

small set of possible values (e.g. MSISDN numbers in a particular country) by brute force attack. 
Instead, this technique is intended to pr
ovide a simple extra layer of protection 
against e.g. accidental disclosure via a 
user interface. 
D.2 Hashed Identifier Usage 
D.2.1 Overview 
An ADMF wishing to provision an NE with a hashed identifier uses the following procedure: 
1) The ADMF populates a Hash Context object with the operator's chosen hash algorithm identifier and ra 

random salt value (see clause D.2.2). 
2) The ADMF issues a CreateObject request containing the 
Hash Context object to the NE (see clause 6.8.1). 
3) The ADMF calculates the hash digest of the required plain-text identifier using the details from the Hash 

Context (see clause D.2.3.2). 
4) The ADMF populates a HashedIdentifier structure with the digest, along with an indication of the target 

identifier type and the identifier of the Hash Context object containing the salt (see clause D.2.3). 
5) The ADMF issues an ActivateTask request containing th
e HashedIdentifier to the NE (see clause 6.2.1). 
The NE can now inspect each candidate identity and create a hash digest using the information in the Hash Context. If 

the digest matches the one in the Hashed
Identifier structure, the NE
 can consider the target identity to have matched. 
Hashed Identifiers may only be used for target identifier types which derive from simple types such as xs:token, and 

which specify a single unambiguous value as a target identifier. Hashed Identifiers may not be used for: 
• target identifier types which are co
mplex types due to poten
tial ambiguities in form
ing a canonical binary 
representation (see clause D.2.3). 
• target identifier types which do not describe a single unambiguous value (such as tcpPortRange) since it is 

impossible to determine whether a given identifier matches the target identifier by comparing hashes.  
However, a given Task may contain both hashed and non-hashed target identifiers (e.g. a hashed IPv4 address along 

with a plain-text tcpPortRange) in its targetIdentifiers list.

-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)46 D.2.2 Hash Context 
A Hash Context is derived from a Generic Object (see clause 6.8.1.1) and consists of the following elements: 
Table D.1: Hash Context structure 
Field Description
 Format M/C/O
 hashAlgorithm 
Gives the object identifier of the hash 
context containing the relevant configuration 
details used to calculate the hash digest. 
Hash name string matching one 

of those defined in the IANA 

Named Information Hash 
Algorithm Registry [25] 
M salt 
Salt to be used when calculating the hash 
digest value (see clause D.2.3). Shall be at 

least 8 octets long. 
XML hexbinary representation of 
the salt value.  
M  The choice of hash algorithm is made by the operator and enforced by the ADMF. ADMFs and NEs supporting hashed 
identifiers shall support the use of the following hash algorithms: 
• sha-256 with 256-bit value length as defined in IETF RFC 6920 [25]. 
• sha-512 with 512-bit value length as defined in IETF RFC 6920 [25]. 
• sha3-512 with 512-bit value length as defined in FIPS PUB 202 [26]. 
Additional algorithms may be supported in both the ADMF and NE. 
If the ADMF requests the creation of a Hash Context object with an unsupported hash algorithm or an insufficiently 
long salt, the NE shall reject the request with an appropriate error.  
A Hash Context and its associated salt may be used by multip
le HashedIdentifier instances 
(see clause D.2.3) to reduce 
the processing burden at the NE, at the cost
 of reducing the number of salts that an
 attacker would need to deal with if 
attempting to exhaustively search for the original target identifier. 
D.2.3 HashedIdentifier 
D.2.3.1 Structure 
A HashedIdentifier consists of the following elements. 
Table D.2: HashedIdentifier structure 
Field Description
 Format M/C/O
 hashContextID Gives the object identifier of the hash context 
containing the relevant configuration details used 
to calculate the hash digest. 
X1ObjectID (see clause D.2.2) M 
targetIdentityType Name of the equivalent plain-text target identity 
element from the TargetIdentifier type. Only 

simple types are supported. 
String M 
hashDigest Digest of the target identifier a
nd salt. XML hexbinary representation of the 
binary digest 
M  D.2.3.2 Hashing procedure 
It is essential that both the ADMF and NE calculate the hashDigest value in the same way. The hashDigest value shall 
be calculated according to
 the following procedure at both NE and ADMF: 
1) Ensure that any plain-text target identity used to calculate a hashDigest is first correctly normalized into the 

format defined by the relevant TargetIdentifier format (see table 5). 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 221
-1 V1.11.1 (2022
-03)47 2) For values where value comparisons are case-insensitive, transform the plain-text identity to lower-case. In 
cases where parts of the value are 
case-insensitive and others are not 
(e.g. SIP URI) then only the case-
insensitive parts shall be lower-cased. 
3) Obtain a binary representation of the plain-text target identity.  
- For simple types derived from xs:token or xs:string, 
the binary representation shall be the octets giving 
the UTF-8 encoding of the plain-text string. 
- For simple types derived from xs:hexbinary, the binary representation shall be the octets represented by 
the hexbinary notation. 
- For simple types derived from xs:integer and which represent unsigned numbers, the binary 

representation shall be the octets of the binary representation of that number given in network byte order 

(i.e. big endian).  
4) Concatenate the octets of the salt 
value from the associated Hash C
ontext to the end of the binary 
representation of the identity. 
5) Take the hash of the concatenated result using the hash
 algorithm identified by the 
associated Hash Context.

 D.3.1.2 Construction of the Hash Context 
The ADMF chooses a salt value of 0x4241792fc4d3d097, and allocates a random UUID for an object identifier. The 

ADMF now has enough information to populate a Hash Context object. 
<X1Object xsi:type="HashContext">   <x1ObjectID>e3d62e2b-d211-433d-b0f9-488ed89ba7c0</x1ObjectID>   <hashAlgorithm>sha-256</hashAlgorithm>   <salt>4241792fc4d3d097</salt> </X1Object>  The ADMF may now issue a CreateObjectRequest message to 
the NE with this Hash Ob
ject (see clause 6.8.1). 
D.3.1.3 Binary representation of the target identity 
In this case, the identity is of type InternationalE164. This
 is a type derived from xs:token, so the binary representation 
is the bytes of the utf-8 representation of the string.

-03)49 Annex E (normative): 
Destination Sets 
E.1 Overview 
When intercepted traffic is to be delivered by the NE to a Destination which belongs to a group of related Destinations 
DIDs can be grouped together under a single DSID (see clause 5.1.3). 
When Destination Sets are used each Task 
is associated with one or more Destin
ation Sets. Prior to associating a Task 
with a given DSID, it is required that a Destination Set with the DSID has already been created as described in 
clause E.2 but there is no requirement that a connectio
n has been successfully established for that DSID.  
Checks regarding availability and status of downstream delivery of information are outside the scope of the present 

document. 
E.2 Destination Set Usage 
E.2.1 Overview 
All Generic Object Methods are applicable to DestinationSetDetails Objects. 
An ADMF wishing to use a DSID within a provisioning request towards an NE uses the following procedure: 
• The ADMF populates a DestinationSetDetails object with the identifiers and values as described in 
clause E.2.2. 
• The ADMF issues a CreateObject request, containing 
the DestinationSetDetails object, to the NE (see 

clause 6.8.1). 
• The ADMF issues an ActivateTask request containing the 
DestinationSetDetails Gene
ric Object ID(s), also 
referred to as the DSID(s), to be used within the ListofDIDs field (see clause 6.2.1). 
It is required that a Destination with the DID has already been created (as described in clause 6.3) before it can be 

included within a Destination Set Details object, although there is no requirement that a connection has been 

successfully established for that DID. 
Depending on the NE implementation, it may not be possible to modify some elements or all of a Destination Set details 
while the Destination Set is in use. If the NE cannot modify one or more of the elements in the ModifyObject request, it 

shall reject the entire ModifyObject request with an appropriate error response. 
The length of time an NE requires to make the changes requested in the ModifyObject request message is an 
implementation detail, but the expectation is that changes are made without undue delay. 
A Destination Set may only be removed if it is not referenc
ed by any Tasks. An NE shall respond with an appropriate 
error if the ADMF attempts to remove a Destination Set that is referenced by a Task.

See clause 5.1. 
M 
Preference An integer representing the DIDs preference of use 
within the Destination Set. Where available for use by 
the NE, DID or DIDs with the lowest preference values 

will be used in prior to those with higher preference 
values. 
Integer. C 
 Where the DestinationSetType included within the DestinationSetDetails is "Redundant" the POI will use the specified 
DIDs as a set of redundant end points, it is mandatory fo
r the "Preference" to be defined for each DID within a 
Destination Set where the DestinationSetType is "Redundant". Preference defines the DIDs order of use with the 

smallest integer indicating the most preferred DID(s). Should the most preferred DID(s) become unavailable the next 

preferred and available DID(s) shall be used.  
It is an implementation decision for the NE to determine whether to duplicate traffic if two or more DIDs with the same 
Preference value are referenced within 
the same DestinationSetDetails object. 
Where the DestinationSetType included within the Destina
tionSetDetails is "Duplicate", the NE will send copies of 
intercepted traffic to all DIDs within the set, preference shall not to be included where the DestintionSetDetails is of 

type "Duplicate".
