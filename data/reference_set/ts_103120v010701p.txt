Executive summary 
The present document defines a protocol for the electronic exchange of legal and technical information for the purposes 
of establishing and managing lawfully required actions (e.g. Lawful Interception). In this phase, the present document is 

intended to provide the underlying functionality for HI-1, as defined in the ETSI LI Reference Model, and it has been 

designed for applicability beyond LI in future phases. 
Introduction 
The present document was constructed in multiple phases. The first phase of the present document consisted of a 

reference architecture. It was created by investigating current
 practices and procedures across TC LI. It makes clear the 
distinction between the process of communicating with the Co
mmunication Service Provider to inform them about the 
interception details (commonly called "tasking") and also communication among government/law 
enforcement/judiciary to establish the warrant (commonly called "warrantry"). The second phase of the present 
document provided a standardized detailed interface based on the 
architecture in the first phase, in particular for LI. The 
present document anticipates that future phases will add other requests for legal action. 
    ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)8 1 Scope 
The present document defines an electronic interface between two systems for the exchange of information relating to 
the establishment and management of lawful required acti
on, typically Lawful Interception. Typically this interface 
would be used between: on one side, a Communications Service Provider; and, on the other side, a Government or Law 

Enforcement Agency who is entitled to request a lawful action. The present document is a specific and detailed example 

of one particular Warrantry interface for eWarrants [i.1]. 
The ETSI reference model for LI (ETSI TS 101 671 [1] or ETSI TS 102 232-1 [2]) defines three interfaces between law 
enforcement and CSPs, called HI-1, HI-2 and HI-3. The protocol defined in the present document is designed to provide 

a large part of the functionality for HI-1. It is not designed to be used for HI-2 (delivery of intercept related information) 

or HI-3 (delivery of communications content). The protocol designed in the present document may also be used for 

interfaces which require structured exchange of information relating to the establishment and management of Lawful 
Interception. The general view is that th
e HI-1 concept can also be used for other legal actions than LI. For that reason 
the present document could, besides LI, also be applied for retained data requests, seized data requests, data 
preservation orders and other similar legal requests.

4 Structure and model 
4.1 Structure of the standard 
The present document defines an interface and data structures that can be used to enable electronic warrant and tasking 

information to be exchanged. The processes for creating,
 approving and implementing a warrant are national matters. 
The present document does not attempt to dictate or define thes
e processes, but provides an interface and data structures 
on which such processes can be built. Likewise, the present document assumes that a suitable physical network 

infrastructure is available. Figure 4.1 shows the conceptual structure of the standard. 
 Figure 4.1: Conceptual structure of the standard 
4.2 Structure of the present document 
Clause 5 defines the how messages are exchanged in the messaging protocol. 
Clause 6 defines the format of the messages exchanged in the messaging protocol. 

Clause 7 describes the data definitions and structures for 
HI-1 Objects that are exchanged and used as part of the 
warrant and tasking processes.

-10)12 Clause 8 describes the data definitions and structures for HI-1 Task Objects. 
Clause 9 describes the transport mechanism(s) used by the messaging protocol. 
4.3 Reference model 
The present document defines an interface between two participants. 
 Figure 4.2: Reference model for WI interface 
The process of approving or enacting a warrant will often involve more than two participants. Multi-party or multi-step 
interactions can, by national agreement, be composed of multiple two-party interactions. For example: 
 Figure 4.3: Example national process composed of WI interactions 
 Figure 4.4: Further example national process composed of WI interactions 
The nature of these "higher-level" multi-party processes will 
be dictated by national legislation, and as such are not 
defined in the present document. 
5 Message Exchange 
HI-1 defines two roles in an HI-1 communication: 
• The Sender generates a Request Message, and transmits it.

-10)13 • The Receiver receives the Request Message, processes it, and returns a Response Message to the Sender. 
HI-1 message exchange therefore follows a simple Request-Response pattern between Sender and Receiver. 
 Figure 5.1 
Note that the roles of Sender and Receiver are logical ones. A given node may act as both a Sender and Receiver for 
different exchanges, depending on the specifics of the relevant national processes, network configuration and 

implementation details. 
Clause 6 describes the structure of Request and Response messages. 
6 Message Structure 
6.1 Overview 
The high-level structure for HI-1 Request and Response messages is shown in figure 6.1. 
 Figure 6.1: High-level message structure

• Message Header. 
• Message Payload (either a Request Payload or a Response Payload).

-10)14 6.2 MessageHeader 6.2.1 Introduction 
Every HI-1 Message shall contain a MessageHeader structure that is the same for all messages and contains basic 
routing and identification information. 
If a Receiver receives a message containing a MessageHeader that does not follow the format and rules given in this 
clause, the Receiver shall reject the entire message with a top-level Action Unsuccessful response (see clause 6.4.9). 
If a Sender receives a message containing a MessageHeader that does not follow the format and rules given above, the 
Sender shall disregard the message. Implemente
rs are encouraged to 
alert the local user. 
6.2.2 Structure 
Table 6.1 shows the structure of every valid MessageHeader within an HI-1 message. 
Table 6.1: MessageHeader 
Field Format Description

ReceiverIdentifier EndpointID (see clause 6.2.4 for details) Nationally unique identifier and country code, 
sufficient to uniquely identify the intended 

Receiver in the message exchange. See 

clause 6.2.4 for details. 
TransactionIdentifier UUID (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]) in IETF 
RFC 4122 [3] canonical form

NationalProfileVersion ShortString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7
]) Version of the national profile that should be 
used to interpret this message. National 

profile shall define the valid format and values 

for this field. 
 The present document does not specify any requirements for interoperability between systems using different versions 
of the present document or a national profile. The required behaviour of systems under such circumstances is a matter 

for national agreement. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)15 6.2.4 EndpointID 
An Endpoint ID is used to provide a nationally 
unique identifier for a Sender or Receiver. 
Table 6.3: EndpointID 
Field Format Description
 CountryCode ISOCountryCode (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]) 
giving 3166-1 alpha-2 code 
Two-letter country code for the country. The 
reserved Country Code XX shall be used for 

international organizations. 
UniqueIdentifier LongString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]) 
Unique identifier sufficient for identifying the 
object/field within the country. 
 Sender and Receiver Identifiers are used within a MessageHeader to uniquely identify Sender and Receiver entities. As 
such, they have to be unique within the country specified by their respective country codes. 
The Receiver shall populate the Receiver Identifier in all Re
sponse messages with its assigned Receiver Identifier. The 
Receiver shall also populate the Sender Identifier with the value specified in the original Request message, unless the 
Receiver is responding with a top level Action Unsuccessful 
payload and is unable to determine the original Sender 
Identifier. This means, for example, that a Receiver sending b
ack a Response message still sets the Sender Identifier to 
the identifier of the original Sender, and the Receiver Identi
fier to its own identifier. If a Receiver cannot determine the 
original Sender Identifier, then the Receiver shall populate the Sender Identifier with the reserved value "UNKNOWN" 

(all capitals). This value may not be used 
as a valid Sender or Receiver Identifier. 
If a Receiver receives a message with a valid but unexpected Receiver Identifier, the Receiver shall reject the entire 

message with a top-level Error Response. 
If a Receiver cannot determine the original Sender Identifier Country Code, then the Receiver shall populate the Sender 
Identifier Country Code with the reserved value "ZZ" (all capitals) in the Response. This value may not be used as a 

value Sender or Receiver country code. 
The precise format of Sender and Receiver Identifiers is for national agreement. 
6.2.5 Transaction
 Identifiers 
The Transaction Identifier is a UUID in IETF RFC 4122 [3] canonical form used within a MessageHeader that uniquely 
identifies a particular HI-1 message exchange between a 
particular Sender and Receiver. As such, the Transaction 
Identifier is unique for a pair of Request and Response messages. 
Senders are responsible for creating Transaction Identifiers 
and maintaining their uniqueness between that Sender and a 
given Receiver. A Receiver that receives a duplicate Transa
ction Identifier from a given Sender may respond with a 
top-level Action Error if such duplication causes a system error, but is otherwise not required to check the uniqueness of 
the Transaction Identifier. 
A Receiver creating a Response message shall populate the Transaction Identifier as specified in the original Request 
message, unless the Receiver is responding with a DELIVER Response (see clause 6.4.10) or Error payload or is unable 

to determine the original Sender, Receiver and Transactio
n Identifiers (e.g. the Request message is corrupted and 
unreadable). If a Receiver cannot determine the original Tr
ansaction Identifier, then the Receiver shall assign the 
Response message a new unique Transaction Identifier. 
6.3 Message Payload 
6.3.1 Introduction 
Every HI-1 Message shall contain a Message Payload structure. A Request Message shall contain a Request Payload, 

while a Response message shall contain a Response payload. For a definition of Request and Response messages, see 

clause 5. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)16 6.3.2 Request Payload 
A Request Payload contains the information sent from a Se
nder to Receiver. It consists of a collection of Action 
Requests (see clause 6.4.2). 
To improve processing efficiency and responsiveness, it is recommended that Action Requests in a Request Payload be 
limited to a single related set of objects, e.g. an Authorisation Object and its dependent Task Objects. 
To ensure error-free and predictable processing of Task Ob
jects, it is recommended that Action Requests concerning 
Authorisation Objects be placed ahead of 
its associated Action Requests concerning Task Objects. The easiest way to 
ensure that this takes place is to put all Action Requests 
concerning Authorisation Objects before any Action Requests 
concerning Tasking Objects in the Request Payload. 

It is also recommended that Action Requests concerning Wa
rrant documentation referenced within a Document Object 
be submitted prior to Action Requests concerning Auth
orisation Objects which reference that documentation. 
6.3.3 Response Payload 
A Response Payload contains information sent back from a 
Receiver to a Sender, in response to a Request Message. 
The result of processing multiple Action Requests in a given Request message shall be as if they were processed in 
order of Action Identifier (see clause 6.4.4). 
On receiving an Action Unsuccessful response, the Sender shall consider that particular Action Request as not having 
been understood or acted on. On receiving a top-level Action 
Unsuccessful structure, the Sender shall consider none of 
the original Request Message to have been understood or acted on. See clause 6.4.9 for more details. 
6.4 Action Request and Responses 
6.4.1 Overview 
Clause 6.4 defines a set of verbs to aid the two parties in creating, updating, exchanging and reporting on the HI-1 

Objects. It does not dictate busine
ss processes that vary nationally. 
6.4.2 Action Requests 
Each Action Request in the Request Payload shall be assigned an Action Identifier (see clause 6.4.4). Each Action 

Request appears in ascending order of the Action Identifier. 
An Action Request shall be one of the following "verbs". 
Table 6.4: Action Request types 
Verb Description
 Definition GET 
Retrieve HI-1 Object 
See clause 6.4.5 
CREATE 
Create new HI-1 Object 
See clause 6.4.6 
UPDATE 
Update existing HI-1 Object 
See clause 6.4.7 
LIST 
List identifiers of HI-1 Objects 
See clause 6.4.8 
DELIVER 
Deliver an HI-1 Object 
See clause 6.4.10 
 
The list of verbs is deliberately limited, as they are not intended to describe the business processes. Such higher level 
processes should instead be represented by the state of the 
relevant HI-1 Object. The present document simply provides 
a mechanism for transferring objects between participants in the process. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)17 6.4.3 Action Responses 
A response message sent from a Receiver to a Sender describes the legibility of the Request message received. An 
Action Response is generated for each Action Request provided in a Request, providing the Request Message as a 

whole could be understood. Each Action Response contains an Action Identifier that correlates with the Action 

Identifier provided in the Request. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a DELIVER Response, the Action 

Identifier shall match the one given in the DELIVER Request, and not any associated with the creation of related 

objects. 
An Action Response shall be one of the following "verbs". 
Table 6.5: Action Response types 
Verb Description
 Definition GET RESPONSE Successful retrieval of HI-1 Object of given identifier in Action Request. See clause 6.4.5 
CREATE RESPONSE Receipt of legible Create Request of given identifier in Action Request. See clause 6.4.6 
UPDATE RESPONSE Receipt of legible Update Request of given identifier in Action Request. See clause 6.4.7 
LIST RESPONSE Successful retrieval of identifiers of
 given type from Action Request. See clause 6.4.8 
ERROR INFORMATION Action Request could not be successfully processed. On receipt of this, 
the Sender shall regard the Action Request as not having been 
processed. 
See clause 6.4.9 
DELIVER RESPONSE Successful receipt of an HI-1 Object. 
See clause 6.4.10 
 6.4.4 Action Identifiers 
Action Identifiers are used in Message Payloads, within Action Requests and Action Responses. The Action Identifier 
correlates an Action Request and Action Response between a given Sender and Receiver. Action Identifiers are 

generated by the Sender. The Action Identifier shall be a zero-based integer counter that is unique for each Action 

Request and corresponding Action Response for a given Transaction Identifier. The Sender shall populate the Request 

Payload with Action Requests in ascending order of Action Identifier. On receiving a Request Message, the Receiver 

shall check that the Action Identifiers are correctly in sequ
ence, starting at zero and increasing by one for each Action 
Identifier. If the Action Identifiers are 
not correctly in sequence, the Receiver shall reject the Request Message with a 
top-level Error. Systems with a manual step should take particular care here to check for duplicates before performing 

any actions. 
6.4.5 GET 
A GET Request represents a request for the Receiver to return a particular HI-1 Object. 
A GET Request shall have the following parameters. 
Table 6.6: GET Request fields 
Field Format Description
 Mandatory?
 Identifier ObjectIdentifier (see clause 7.1.2) Uniquely identifies the HI-1 Object that the Sender 
wishes to retrieve.

If the Receiver is unable to retrieve an Object with the de
fined ObjectIdentifier, then an Action Error response with an 
appropriate error code is returned. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)18 6.4.6 CREATE 
A CREATE Request represents a request for the Receiver to create a new HI-1 Object. 
A CREATE Request shall have the following parameters. 
Table 6.8: CREATE Request fields 
Field Format Description
 Mandatory?
 HI1Object HI-1 Object Representation of the HI-1 Object to be created by the Receiver. Yes 
 The Receiver shall respond to a successful CREATE Request with a CREATE Response with the following parameters. 
Table 6.9: CREATE Response fields 
Field Format Description
 Mandatory?
 Identifier Object Identifier (see clause 7.1.2) Value provided in the CREATE Request. Yes 
HI1Object HI-1 Object 
HI-1 Object that is identified by the identifier. No 
 
If the Receiver is unable to create an HI-1 Object with the 
defined identifier, then an Action Error response with an 
appropriate error code is returned. Unsuccessful creations
 could be as a result of an already used identifier. 
The Receiver may, optionally, return an updated version of the Object as part of the CREATE Response (see table 6.9). 
This may be useful in situations where the Receiver populate
s or updates additional fields
 as part of processing the 
CREATE request. 
The Receiver shall set the Generation of a created Object to 1 (see clause 7.1.3). 
6.4.7 UPDATE 
An UPDATE Request represents a request for the Receiver to update values in an existing HI-1 Object. 

An UPDATE Request shall have the following parameters. 
Table 6.10: UPDATE Request fields 
Field Format Description
 Mandatory?
 HI1Object HI-1 Object Representation of the HI-1 Object to be updated by the Receiver. Yes 
 
The Receiver shall respond to a successful UPDATE Request with an UPDATE Response with the following 
parameters. 
Table 6.11: UPDATE Response fields 
Field Format Description
 Mandatory?
 Identifier Object Identifier (see clause 7.1.2) Value provided in the UPDATE Request. Yes 
HI1Object HI-1 Object 
HI-1 Object that is identified by the identifier. No 
 If the Receiver is unable to update an Object with the de
fined identifier, then an Action Error response is returned. 
Unsuccessful updates could be as a result of using an identifier that does not exist. 
Receivers shall observe the following on performing an UPDATE Request: 
• If a single-valued field is present in the UPDATE Request Object, the Receiver should set the value of the 
equivalent field to match. 
• If a list-field is present in the UPDATE Request Object, the Receiver should set the contents of the equivalent 

list field to match, i.e. overwrite the entire list and not append to it. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)19 • If a field is absent in the UPDATE Request Object, the Receiver should leave the value of the equivalent field 
unchanged. 
If the request can be understood and parsed, but cannot be
 acted upon, then the Receiver shall return an Error 

Information as described in clause 6.4.9. 
The Receiver shall update the Generation of an Object that has been updated (see clause 7.1.3). 
6.4.8 LIST 
A LIST Request represents a request for the Receiver to list 
records of HI-1 Object iden
tifiers that the Sender is 
permitted to have knowledge of, optionally depending on the type requested. Although no business processes are 
defined in the present document, the Receiver is responsible for listing only the identifiers that a Sender is allowed to 

access. Details of how to determine this shall be specified in the relevant national profile. 
This method shall only be allowed if explicitly required by the relevant national profile. Use of the capability on a 
national basis should be carefully considered for its security implications. If the Receiver does not allow the use of the 

LIST verb, then it shall respond to a LIST Request with an Action Error response. 
The list of objects provided in a response message may be limited subject to national agreement, for example to only 
Active objects, or to a configured number of most recent 
objects. This is needed to prevent potentially many years 
worth of data being dumped on the requestor in a message too large for the requestor system to handle. Such details 

shall be specified in the relevant national profile. 
A LIST Request shall have the following parameters.

 If the Receiver contains no Objects of the defined type, then an empty list is returned. 

If the Request can be understood and parsed, but cannot be acted upon, then the Receiver shall return an Error 
Information as described in clause 6.4.9. 
In the particular case that the ObjectType is set to "Notifi
cation", the Receiver shall only return the Object Identifiers of 
instances of a NotificationObject whose NewNotification flag is set (see clause 7.4.4 for more details). Implementations 
may need additional rules or logic to restrict the association of instances of a NotificationObject. Where needed, such 

logic shall be specified by the relevant national profile. 
6.4.9 Action Unsuccessful Information 
The Receiver shall respond to unsuccessful requests with an Action Unsuccessful Information structure with the 

following parameters. 
Table 6.15: Action Unsuccessful Information fields

 Mandatory?
 ErrorCode Integer 
Integer code specifying the type of error. Yes 
ErrorInformation LongString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]) Detail of the error that occurred.

 If the message received by the Receiver is understood and parsed, but an individual Action Request cannot be acted on, 
then the response shall contain an individual Action Unsuccessful Response. On receiving this Action Unsuccessful 
Response, a Sender shall consider the associ
ated request to have not been acted on. 
If the message received by the Receiver as a whole cannot be understood, then the response shall contain a top-level 

Action Unsuccessful structure explaining the nature of the error, instead of a collection of Action Responses. This shall 

only be used in error conditions which prevent any of the Action Requests being understood - for example, a fatal

e. On receiving this top-level Action Unsuccessful Error 
structure, a Sender shall consider none of the original request to have been understood or acted on. 
6.4.10 DELIVER 
A DELIVER Request represents a mechanism to deliver information in response to a lawful request represented by 

another HI-1 Object, for example where a LEA creates an LD
TaskObject and the CSP discloses data by sending one or 
more DeliveryObject(s). 
A DELIVER Request shall have the following parameters. 
Table 6.16: DELIVER Request fields 
Field Format Description
 Mandatory?
 Identifier ObjectIdentifier (see clause 7.1.2) Uniquely identifies the Delivery Object that the 
Responder wishes to deliver.

e object. It contains the following parameters. 
Table 6.17: DELIVER Response fields 
Field Format Description
 Mandatory?
 Identifier ObjectIdentifier (see clause 7.1.2) Identifier of the HI-1 Object delivered in the DELIVER 
request 
Yes 
 While the DELIVER verb may be used to deliver any HI-1 Object, it is primarily intended for delivering Delivery 
Objects (see clause 10). 
7 Data Definitions 
7.1 HI1Object 
7.1.1 Overview 
HI1Objects represent the current state of a particular national
 process. The relevant national profile shall specify which 
fields are required for a particular HI1Object to 
be valid within the relevant national processes. 
All HI1Objects have the following top-level structure. 
Table 7.1: HI-1Object 
Field Format Description
 ObjectIdentifier 
UUID (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]) given in 
IETF RFC 4122 [3] canonical form 
Uniquely identifies the Object (see 
clause 7.1.2). 
CountryCode 
ISOCountryCode (see ETSI 
TS 103 280 [7]) giving ISO 3166-1 

Alpha-2 code [14] 
Two-letter country code for the country. If 

the Owner Identifier identifies an 

international organization, the reserved 

Country Code XX. 
OwnerIdentifier 
ShortString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7])
 String to represent the agency/organization 
involved. Format for national agreement. 
Generation 
Positive integer 
Indicates the generation or version of the 
Object (see clause 7.1.3). 
ExternalIdentifier 
LongString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]) Optional identifier for the Object, as 
assigned by the Receiver. For correlation 
with legacy or pre-HI-1 systems. 
AssociatedObjects 
List of ObjectIdentifiers (see clause 7.1.4) Indicated other Objects which are 
associated with a given Object. 
LastChanged 
QualifiedDateTime (see ETSI 
TS 103 280 [7]) 
Indicates the last time this Object was 
altered, either via HI-1 or locally. 
NationalHandlingParameters Defined by the relevant nati
onal profile Nationally-defined information concerning 
the handling of the Object. 
 7.1.2 ObjectIdentifier 
An ObjectIdentifier is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify and refer to a particular HI1Object. To follow 
RESTful principles, an HI1Object should be identified by a pe
rsistent identifier to refer to or locate the HI1Object. This 

identifier is essential to the automated handling and management of the lifecycle of the object, and is therefore not 

permitted to change for the lifetime of the HI1Object 
as it is used to uniquely identify the HI1Object. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)22 7.1.3 Generation 
The Generation parameter indicates how many times the HI1Object has been changed or updated. 
The Receiver shall set the Generation of an HI1Object to 1 when it is created. A Sender shall not specify the Generation 
as part of a CREATE Request, and a Receiver shall return an Action Unsuccessful Information response if it attempts 

to. 
The Receiver shall increment the Generation of an Object by 1 each time it is altered or updated, either via HI-1 or by 
other means. A Sender may optionally specify the Generation as part of an UPDATE Request. In this case, the Receiver 
shall check whether the Generation matches the current Generation of the Object. If so, the Receiver shall process the 
UPDATE Request normally, and then increment the Generation. If not, the Receiver shall respond with an Action 

Unsuccessful Information response. If the Sender omits the Generation as part of the UPDATE Request, then the 

Receiver shall process the UPDATE normally and increment the Generation. 
7.1.4 AssociatedObjects 
The AssociatedObjects field gives a list 
of other HI1Objects which are related or associated in some way with this 
HI1Object. Examples include TaskObjects associated with 
an AuthorisationObject, or DocumentObjects associated 
with an AuthorisationObject or TaskObject. 
Table 7.2: AssociatedObjects 
Field Format Description
 AssociatedObjects List of ObjectIdentifiers List of other
 HI1Objects which are related or associated with the 
current HI1Object. 
 7.1.5 LastChanged 
The LastChanged field indicates the date and time that the HI1Object was last changed, either as a result of an HI-1 

Action, or as the result of local activity at the Receiver (e.g. 
local operator intervention, or a change of workflow state). 
This field shall be set by the Receiver when an HI1Object is first created, and each time it is modified as a result of 

either an HI-1 Action or local activity. 
Only the Receiver may change the content of the LastChanged field. A Receiver shall reject an Action which attempts 
to modify or set the LastChanged field. 
7.1.6 NationalHandlingParameters 
The NationalHandlingParameters structure is provided 
to allow the relevant national profile to specify 

nationally-specific handling information (e.g. routing information or security labelling). 
The format and use of the NationalHandlingParameters structure shall be defined in the relevant national profile. 
7.2 AuthorisationObject

7.4 NotificationObject 7.4.1 Overview 
The NotificationObject is a means for a Receiver to notify a Se
nder of any change or update to an HI1Object or set of 
HI1Objects that was not due to a direct HI-1 Action from the Sender. Such changes may occur for a number of reasons, 
for example local user interaction at the Receiver. 
The use of NotificationObjects are 
subject to national agreement. 
When a Receiver wishes to notify a Sender of changes 
to an HI1Object or set of HI1Objects, it may create a 
NotificationObject associated to that Object via the Associat
edObjects field. A NotificationO
bject may be associated to 
more than one Object. Similarly, an HI1Object may be associated to multiple NotificationObjects as it may be subject 
to a number of changes over time. 
NotificationObjects may only be created by the Receiver. A Receiver that receives a CREATE Action attempting to 
create a NotificationObject shall return an error. 
The NotificationObject consists of the following fields. Further details are given in the clause 7.4.2. 
Table 7.17: NotificationObject

example, a summary of any changes, or the reason for the notification). 
A Receiver shall ignore any attempt by a Sender to UPDATE the value of the Notification details field. 
7.4.3 NotificationType 
The NotificationType field indicates the type of Notification 
being given. It is given as a NotificationType Dictionary 
Entry. The NotificationType Dictionary is defined in table 7.18 (see annex F for more details on Dictionaries). Since the 
list of notification types is tightly coup
led to national processes and workflow, it 
is expected that each national profile 
will need to extend this dictionary.

 Value Meaning
 General 
A general notification that a change has occurred with the specified Objects. 
 7.4.4 NewNotification 
The NewNotification flag is used to indicate whether the noti
fication is new, and therefore whether it should be returned 
in a query for New Notifications (see clause 6.4.8). 
When a Receiver creates a new NotificationObject, the NewNotif
ication flag shall be set to True. The NewNotification 
Flag may be set to False, thereby removing it from the No
tification Objects returned by the Receiver when queried for 
new Notifications, in any of the following ways: 
• Once a Sender is satisfied that it has been notified, it may UPDATE the NewNotification field to False 
explicitly. 
• Once a Receiver is satisfied that the Sender has been notified (e.g. upon Receiving a GET or UPDATE for all 

AssociatedObjects) the Receiver may change the NewNotif
ication field to False. The logic and circumstances 
under which the Receiver makes such a change shall be specified by the relevant national profile. 
Archiving and persistence of Notification Objects once the 
NewNotification flag has been cleared is a matter for 
national agreement. 
7.4.5 NotificationTimestamp 
The NotificationTimestamp field shall be set by the Receive
r to the time at which the notification event occurred. 
The Receiver shall ignore any attempt by a Sender to UPDATE the value of the NotificationTimestamp field. 
7.4.6 NationalNotificationParameters 
The use and definition of the NationalNotificationParameters structure is for national agreement. See annex G.

8.1 Overview 
This clause defines a set of HI1Object definitions that can be used to describe "Tasks". These Objects are intended to 
describe the technical details of a request or instruction, an
d will typically by associated
 with an AuthorisationObject 
which represents the legal basis for the technical request. 
The present document defines two type of Task Objects, th
e LITaskObject, which represents a technical request to 
perform Lawful Intercept and the LDTaskObject, which repres
ents a technical request to perform Lawful Disclosure. 
8.2 LITaskObject 
8.2.1 Overview 
An LITaskObject represents the state of an LI task - that is, the act of intercepting of a communication. This 
corresponds to the WarrantTargetID and WarrantTechSpec elements defined in ETSI TR 103 690 [i.1]. In general, 

multiple tasks may be authorised by a single warrant. 
The LITaskObject consists of the following fields. Further details are given in clause 8.2.2.

9.1 Overview 
This clause describes the transport and encoding mechanisms used in exchanging WI messages. 
9.2 Encoding 9.2.1 XML Schema 
Messages are encoded in XML format [4] according to th
e WI XSD Schema, which is provided as an XML XSD 
Schema Set that accompanies the present document. Each National Profile may, subject to national agreement, specify 
additional schema files that give definitions for national parameters (see annex G) that shall be considered as part of the 

schema set. 
The Sender and Receiver shall only send messages that are successfully validated against the schema. 
9.2.2 Error conditions 
If a Receiver receives a WI Message which does not conform 
to the WI XSD Schema, it sh
all not attempt to process 
any of the contents. It shall respond with a top-level Action Unsuccessful message containing a suitable error code. 
9.2.3 Message signing and encryption 
Implementations may choose to digitally sign and/or encrypt messages for security and assurance purposes. If used, the 
signature information shall be placed in element as the last child element of the root message element. 
If this is required, the relevant national profile shall specify the relevant details for populating the signature element. It 
is expected that future versions of the present document 
will include digital signature recommendation as defined by 
ETSI TC CYBER. 
9.3 HTTP Transport 
9.3.1 Use of HTTP 
HTTP Transport is the defined transport mechanism for WI messages in the present document, unless a 

nationally-defined transport mechanism is to be used (see clause 9.4). For security details relating to the HTTP 

exchange, see clause 9.3.4. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)43 9.3.2 Client/Server architecture 
When using HTTP for WI message exchange, the Sender acts as an HTTP client while the Receiver acts as an HTTP 
server. 
9.3.3 HTTP Configuration 
The POST method shall be used for all HTTP requests. The body of the POST message shall contain a single HI1 

Request Message, as defined in clause 5 and clause 6.3.1, and encoded as per clause 9.2.1. 
The Content-Type shall be set to text/xml. 

Cacheing shall not be used. 

In the absence of HTTP transport level errors, the Receiver shall respond with an HTTP 200 OK response. The body of 
the response shall contain a single HI-1 Response Message, as defined in clause 5 and clause 6.3.1, and encoded as per 
clause 9.2.1. HTTP Status Codes shall not be used to in
dicate WI application layer errors. Well-formed WI Response 

messages containing the appropriate error codes shall be used. 
9.3.4 Transport security 
Implementations shall support HTTPS as defined in IETF RFC 2818 [5], including the support for mutual 

authentication through bidirectional certificate usage. Impl
ementations shall use HTTPS unless specifically directed 
otherwise in the relevant national profile. 
The use of pre-shared keys may be considered for authenticat
ion at the transport layer. If this option is selected, the 
specifications set forth in IETF RFC 4279 [6] shall be followed. 
The relevant national profile shall provide details for the agreed security requirements for the transport layer, including 
specification of any necessary encryption, signatures or hash functions. 
Issues such as key management, key length, key exchange, choice of cryptographic algorithm, etc. are outside of the 
scope of the present document. It is expected that future versions of the present document will include best practice 

recommendation as defined by ETSI TC CYBER. 
9.4 Nationally-defined Transport 
If HTTP transport as defined in the above clause is not 
to be used in a particular
 country, a nationally-defined 
alternative may be agreed on a national basis. Such a transport mechanism shall not break any of the requirements of the 

clause 9.2. 
10 Delivery Object 
10.1 Overview 
A delivery Object represents the delivery of information to a request for that information as part of a task. 
10.2 DeliveryObject 
10.2.1 Overview 
The DeliveryObject consists of the following fields. Where the 
DeliveryObject is created in response to a Task Object, 
that Task Object shall be referenced in the AssociatedObjects field of the DeliveryObject.

Example usage scenarios for HI-1 
A.1 Overview 
This annex shows some characteristics message flows for eWarrant exchange. 
A.2 Direct communication 
In this scenario the LEA directly requests warrant authorisation from a competent Warrant Approving Authority, and 
then passes the technical details for the interception on to the CSP for action.

3 Request for interception. Tasking information, plus whatever 
subset of the warrant information is 
required. 
 4 Intercepted product. Intercepted product. 
Covered by HI-2/3. 
 A.3 Single "Central Authority" 
In this scenario, LEAs interact with the CSPs via a central br
oker authority. LEAs still interact with the warrant granting 
authorities directly. 
The Central Authority may also take responsibility for fanning out an LEA's request to multiple CSPs, if appropriate. 
Depending on the details of the jurisdiction, CSPs may or may not require a subset of the warrant information to be 
passed along with the tasking information.

 A.4 Multiple Approving Authorities 
A.4.1 Overview 
In this scenario, the LEA's request for interception passes through two separate Approving Authorities for approval. In 
principle, this could be generated for three or more Approving Authorities. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)48 A.4.2 "Serial" interaction 
This may happen "serially", such that the first of the Warrant Approving Authorities is responsible for passing the 
relevant information on to the next Warrant Approving Authority. Information regarding the warrant is then passed 
back from the CSP in a similar way. In this scenario, th
e results of interception are passed directly to the LEA. 
Although it is not shown here, it is possible that results of interception could also be mediated through one or more 

authorities, as in scenario A.2 above.

each of the Warrant Approving Authorities. Once the approvals have been collected, the LEA then submits the details 
of the interception required to the CSP directly.

Example Template National Profile 
B.1 Introduction 
B.1.1 Overview 
National tasking and warrant processes are tightly coupled to national legislation. While there are many broad 
similarities between different countries, the processes are subtly different in each country. The present document does 
not attempt to dictate these processes, but rather support whatever processes are required by national law. 
To do so, the standard defines a common set of definitions for representing and exchanging authorisation and task 
information, but does not define the national business logic or rules that are applied to them. These are left to national 

jurisdictions to define in their national profiles of the present document. 
This annex gives an example, or template, national profile. The purpose of this annex is as follows: 
• To illustrate to readers of the standard how HI-1 can be used to build national processes. 
• To demonstrate how the present document and a national profile are intended to interact. 
• To give drafting guidance to those who are writing national profiles. 
Clause B.1.2 gives a suggested structure and content for a national profile. 
B.1.2 Structure of this annex 
Clause B.2 contains an Example National Profile. It is written from the perspective of a fictional national jurisdiction, 
such that if the text in clause B.2 were made a separate document, it would form an illustrative example of a fictional 

national profile. 
The content of B.1 (this clause) should be read as part of
 the present document. It provides the necessary explanation 
and background for the text in clause B.2. 
B.1.3 Checklist for National Profile authors

For the purposes of the Example National Profile, it is assumed there is a fictional national jurisdiction. 
This jurisdiction has a country code of "XX", which is a reserved ISO 3166-1 [14] alpha-2 country code. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)52 The jurisdiction has a national process which follows the model given in clause A.2 of the present document. For 
simplicity and brevity, the jurisdiction is only using the present document to exchange information between the LEA 

and the CSP. It is assumed that the earlier interactions between the LEA and the warrant signing authority have 

occurred. 
B.2 Example National Profile 
B.2.1 Approach and reference model 
B.2.1.1 Overview 
This national profile follows ETSI TS 103 120 (the present document). The approach, structure of this national profile, 

and reference model follow the details given in clause 4, subject to the following clarifications and additions. 
This national profile defines how ETSI TS 103 120 (the present document) is to be used for interactions between an 
LEA and a CSP. Specifically, the interactions covered by this national profile are as follows: 
• Communication of a new Warrant, and associated Tasking instructions. 
• Cancellation of an existing Warrant. 
• Communication of a new Tasking Instruction under an existing Warrant. 
B.2.1.2 Warrants 
A new Warrant is created by obtaining a Warrant Instrument from the Warrant Issuing Authority. A Warrant Instrument 

is represented by a Document Object. For a Warran
t Instrument to be valid, it has to contain: 
• A Warrant Reference, consisting of the letter "W" followed by a six-digit number. 
• The name of the person signing the Warrant Instrument. 
• A signature date, in the past. 
• An end date, later than the start date. 
A Warrant is cancelled by obtaining a Cancellation Instrument from the Warrant Issuing Authority. A cancelled 

Warrant automatically stops all Tasking Instructions related to that Warrant. For a Cancellation Instrument to be valid, 

it has to contain: 
• A valid Cancellation Reference, consisting of the letter "C", followed by a six-digit number. 
• The name of the person signing the Cancellation Instrument. 
• A signature date, in the past. 
B.2.1.3 Tasking Instructions 
A Tasking Instruction is issued as part of a Warrant by the LEA. 
For a Tasking Instruction to be valid, it has to: 
• Be part of a valid Warrant. 
• Have a valid LIID. 
• Specify the communications address to be intercepted.
 The only valid type of communications address is 
MSISDN. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103
 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)53 • Specify the time period inside which interception is sought, which has to be within the period of validity of the 
Warrant. 
B.2.1.4 Representation by HI-1 Objects 
Figure B.1 shows how the concepts described in the 
previous clauses are represented by HI-1 Objects. 
 Figure B.1: Mapping of concepts to HI-1 Objects 
B.2.2 Message Structure 
B.2.2.1 Overview 
The details in clause 6 have to be followed, subject to the following clarifications and additions in this clause. 
B.2.2.2 Version information 
The NationalProfile Owner is set to "XX". 
The NationalProfileVersion is set to "v1.0". 

Future versions of this national profile will specify interoperability requirements. 
B.2.2.3 Sender and Receiver Identifiers 
The Sender Identifier and Receiver Identifiers have a country code of "XX". 

The Sender and Receiver Unique Identifier fields consist of eight alphanumeric characters. 
B.2.2.4 LIST semantics 
The Receiver has to support the LIST verb. 
The Receiver can only return Object Identifiers for HI-1 Objects that are owned by the Sender (that is, the Sender 
Identifier matches the Object's Owner Identifier). 
The number of matches returned is not to be limited.

then the Status is "Invalid". 
• If the Authorisation Object is associ
ated with a valid Document Object re
presenting a Cancellation Instrument, 
then the Status is "Cancelled". 
• If the Authorisation does not have an AuthorisationTimespan StartTime after the date of the signature of the 

associated Warrant Instrument Document Object, the Status is "Invalid".

B.2.5 Example XML 
B.2.5.1 Introduction 
The following example XML messages illustrate both the principles of HI-1 and the application to this national profile. 
The scenario is not an example of good programming practice or application design, but is intended to highlight some 

of the key aspects of HI-1. 
The example messages consist of three transactions: 
Request 1: 
In the first request message, the Sender asks to CREATE an AuthorisationObject, and an associated 
LITaskObject which is associated to it. 
Response 1:
 The Receiver responds, indicating that both CREATE Requests were accepted, but not returning any 
further information. 

Request 2:
 The Sender asks to retrieve the current state of the AuthorisationObject and the LITaskObject. 
Response 2:
 The Receiver supplies the current state of both. It
 can be seen that both are "Invalid", since the 
AuthorisationObject is not associated with a valid Document
 Object, as per the details AuthorisationStatus rules given 
above. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)58 Request 3:
 The Sender issues a CREATE request to create the rele
vant Document Object, and an UPDATE to associate 
the AuthorisationObject with the 
newly created Document Object. 
Response 3:
 The Receiver indicates that both requests succeeded. Further, in the UPDATE Response, it provides an 
updated view of the state, which shows that the Authorisation is now in the "Active" state. 
Request 4: 
In the first request message, the Sender asks to CREATE an AuthorisationObject, and an associated 
LDTaskObject which is associated to it. 
Response 4:
 The Receiver responds, indicating that both CREATE Requests were accepted, but not returning any 
further information. 
Response 4 (delivery):
 The Receiver responds, returning a DeliveryObject 
in response to the lawful disclosure request 
in the LDTaskObject.

Dictionaries 
F.1 Overview 
The DictionaryEntry type is used to provide for fields that can be easily and unambiguously extended by national 
implementers without needing to change the underlying schema or the HI-1 message parsing and storing aspects of an 

implementation (e.g. a database). 
This annex describes the following: 
• The definition of the DictionaryValue type and associated dictionaries. 
• Definitions, procedures and conventions concerning the definition and use of dictionaries. 
F.2 DictionaryEntry type 
The DictionaryEntry type is intended to represent a single string value chosen from an extensible enumerated list. It is 
defined as follows. 
Table F.1: DictionaryEntry 
Field Format Description
 Owner ShortString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]). Name of 
the owner of the dictionary (see clause F.3.2). 
Name ShortString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]). Name of th
e dictionary from which the value is chosen (see 
clause F.3.3). 
Value ShortString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]). Value chosen from the dictionary. 
 A dictionary of DictionaryEntry values shall consist of the following definitions. 
Table F.2: Required informati
on when defining a dictionary 
Field Format Description
 Owner ShortString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]). Name of 
the owner of the dictionary (see clause F.3.2). 
Name ShortString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]). Name of th
e dictionary from which the value is chosen (see 
clause F.3.3). 
Value ShortString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]). A label wh
ich is unique within the dictionary, and assigned a 
meaning. 
Meaning LongString (see ETSI TS 103 280 [7]). A human-readable definition of the meaning associated with the 
Value. 
 
For more details on the definition and use of dictionaries, see clause F.3. 
F.3 Definition and use of dictionaries 
F.3.1 Overview 
This clause defines the definition and use of dictionaries. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 103 120 V1.7.1 (2020
-10)66 F.3.2 Owner 
Each dictionary has a defined owner. The owner of a dictionary is responsible for the definition of the dictionary, as 
well as the maintenance and publication of the dictionary. All dictionaries shall contain at least the information 
specified in clause F.2. 
A dictionary owner is specified by a string value. The following owners are defined by the present document: 
• "ETSI": The dictionary is owned by ETSI, and defined in the present document. 
• A valid ISO 3166-1 [14] country code: The dictionary is owned and defined by the relevant national authority 
for the country specified by the country code. 
F.3.3 Name 
Each dictionary shall have a defined name which is unique within the owner of that dictionary. A name may be any 

valid ShortString. 
F.3.4 Use of dictionaries 
Any field which the present document defines as a DictionaryEn
try shall either specify an ETSI dictionary of default 
values, or specify that the permissible values shall be given in a nationally-defined dictionary. 
If an ETSI dictionary is specified, then each national profile 
may specify additional
 dictionaries that 
contain additional 
permissible types and values, as well as confirming or clarifying the handling of ETSI defined values If an ETSI 
dictionary is not specified, then each national profile shall eith
er specify a dictionary of permissible values, or state that 
the field shall not be used. 
It is strongly discouraged to introduce ambiguity by duplicating ETSI-defined values in nationally-owned dictionaries. 
Should ETSI choose to adopt a value already defined in a nationally-owned dictionary, the owner is strongly 
encouraged to consider whether to 
retain the nationally-defined value. 
A national profile shall not modify any dictionary that it is not the owner of by adding or removing values. However, it 
is permissible for a national profile to define the handling of ETSI-defined values. 
F.3.5 Machine-readable dictionary definitions 
Implementers are encouraged to allow Dictionary definitions to be easily updated to e.g. storing them in a database 

table, or ingesting them as a configuration file. 
In order to facilitate this, an XML XSD schema is provided alongside the present document that defines a 
machine-readable format for Dictionary definitions 
("ts_103120v010701p0.zip"). Additionally, the dictionary 
definitions given in the present document are supplied as an
 XML file which conforms to the dictionary specification 
("ts_103120v010701p0.zip"). 
National profiles may specify additional dictionaries in additional XML files.

Drafting conventions for 
National Parameters G.1 Overview 
This clause gives normative drafting conventions and guidelines that shall be used when drafting National Parameters 
for use in the National Parameter extension points. 
G.2 Drafting conventions 
National profiles are encouraged to restri
ct the number of national extensions to a minimum, and use standard fields 
and/or extended dictionary types where possible 
(see annex F for more details on dictionaries). 
A national profile shall specify whether a National Parameter definition exists for each of the extension points defined 

in the standard. An extension point can be identified in the following way: 
• The element name begins with "National". 
• The element is defined as being "abstract" in the schema.
