-10)7 Introduction 
The objective of the present document is to form the basis for a standardized handover interface for use by both 
telecommunications service providers and network operators, in
cluding Internet Service Providers that will deliver the 
interception information required by Law Enforcement Authorities under various European treaties and national 

regulations. 
The present document describes how to handover intercepte
d information via IP-based networks from a CSP to an 
LEMF. The present document covers the transportation of traffic, but does not specify functionality within CSPs or 
LEMF (see clause 4.1). The present document handles the transportation of intercepted Content of Communication 

(CC), Intercept-Related Information (IRI), transport related information (TRI) and HI1 notification information. The 

tasking and management of Lawful Interception via the HI1 interface is outside the scope of the present document. 
The present document is intended to be general enough to be used in a variety of situations: it is not focused on a 
particular IP-based service. The present document therefore pr
ovides information that is not dependent on the type of 
service being intercepted. In particular the present document describes delivery mechanisms (clause 6), and the 
structure and header details (clause 5) for both HI2 and HI3 information. 
References within the main body of the present document are made if applicable to the 3GPP specification number with 
in square brackets the reference number as listed in clause 2. In clause 2 "References" the corresponding ETSI 

specification number is indicated with a reference to the 
3GPP specification number. 3GPP specifications are available 
faster than the equivalent ETSI specifications.

-10)8 1 Scope 
The present document specifies the general aspects of HI2 and HI3 interfaces for handover via IP based networks. 
The present document: 
• specifies the modular approach used for specifying IP based handover interfaces; 
• specifies the header(s) to be added to IRI and CC sent over the HI2 and HI3 interfaces respectively; 
• specifies protocols for the transfer of IRI and CC across the handover interfaces; 
• specifies protocol profiles for the handover interface. 
The present document is designed to be used where appropria
te in conjunction with other deliverables that define the 
service-specific IRI data formats (including ETSI TS 102 227 [i.1], ETSI TS 101 909-20-1 [33], ETSI 
TS 101 909-20-2 [34], ETSI TS 102 232-2 [5], ETSI TS 102 232-3 [6], ETSI TS 102 232-4 [32], ETSI 

TS 102 232-5 [37], ETSI TS 102 232-6 [36] and ETSI TS 102 232-7 [38]). Where possible, the present document aligns 
with ETSI TS 133 108 [9] and ETSI TS 101 671 [4] and su
pports the requirements and capabilities defined in ETSI 
TS 101 331 [1] and ETSI TR 101 944 [i.4]. 
For the handover of intercepted data within GSM/UMTS PS and CS domains, the present document does not override 
or supersede any specifications or requirements in ETSI TS 133 108 [9] and ETSI TS 101 671 [4].

The first stage includes the creation or separation of intercepted data from the target network or target service, and the 

creation of IRI data. It is typically the responsibility of the CSP and is outside the scope of the present document. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)14 The second stage ("Handover interface") consists of formatti
ng the results of interception (except where IRI formats are 
specified in other standards), managing the connection between the CSP Mediation Functionality (MF) and the Law 
Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) and transporting the data. It should as far as possible be independent of the 

other stages and is the joint responsibility of the CSP and the LEA. The present document focuses on the handover 

interface. 
The third stage includes functionality for interpreting and di
splaying the results of interception. It is typically the 
responsibility of the LEA and is outside the scope of the present document. 
4.2 Intercepted data types 
4.2.1 Introduction 
Interception is possible at the followin
g network elements: access element, network connectivity element and service 
element (as defined in ETSI TR 101 944 [i.4], clause 5.1). Each method is associated with one or more OSI Layer(s) 
and produces intercepted data in one or more formats, as shown by table 1 (see also ETSI TR 101 944 [i.4], figure 3). 
Table 1: Intercepted data types 
Component OSI Layer(s)
 Format of intercepted data
 Access provider 
1 (Physical) 
Physical PDUs 
2 (Data link) 
Data link PDUs 
3 (Network) 
(IP) Datagrams 
Network connectivity 3 (Network) 
(IP) Datagrams 
Service provider 5/7 (Application) Application layer transactions (but see clause 4.2.2) 
 The present document covers the handover of data in the following two cases: 
• "Network level" interception, consisting of (IP) datagrams from Network Operators or Access Providers. 
• "Application level" interception, consisting of application layer transactions from Service Providers. 
The present document does not cover the handover of intercep
ted physical PDUs or data link PDUs (OSI Layer 1 and 
Layer 2). 
NOTE: The application level is also sometimes called the "service level"; the present document always refers to 
"application level" to avoid confusion over the term service. 
4.2.2 Interception at network operator or access provider 
The format of the information a NWO/AP/SvP can be expected to deliver is based on the level of 
the service it 
provides
. For example, when a NWO provides Internet Access, at
 best, the NWO can be expected to provide a copy of 
the IP packets it transports. Only an Email service provider
 should be asked, for example, to have Email information 
delivered in the format of Email. 
4.2.3 Interception at service providers 
In some circumstances, service providers may find it difficult to intercept target traffic at the application level. 
Examples of such cases are: 
• The application-level transactions are processed by off-
the-shelf equipment that the service provider is unable 
to alter. 
• There are security or maintainability issues relating to modifying the application-level code. 
In these circumstances the alternative is for the service provider to intercept target traffic at the network level. This 

alternative is only acceptable subject to circumstances agreed by CSP and LEA.

-10)15 4.3 Relationship to other standards 
The present document describes those parts of the handover interface that are not service-specific i.e. that do not relate 
to any one service in particular. The following information is 
not considered to be service-
specific, and is included in 
the present document: 
• The framework for data handover. 
• The generic header information to be added to HI2 and HI3 traffic. 
• The transport protocol for data handover. 
In most cases the present document should be used in conjunction with an additional service-specific standard. The 
service-specific standard fills in the remaining details, including: 
• Guidance on how to intercept the service in question. 
• When HI2 and HI3 shall be sent and what information it shall contain. 
• Any relevant HI1 information. 
The following service-specific standards have been designed to be used in conjunction with this one (other standards 

may also be suitable for use with the present document): 
• ETSI TS 102 232-2 [5]: "Service-specific details for messaging services". 
• ETSI TS 102 232-3 [6]: "Service-specific details for internet access services". 
• ETSI TS 102 232-4 [32]: "Service-specific details for Layer 2 Services". 
• ETSI TS 102 232-5 [37]: "Service-specific details for IP Multimedia Services". 
• ETSI TS 102 232-6 [36]: "Service-specific details for PSTN/ISDN services; Handover specification for IP 

delivery". 
• ETSI TS 102 232-7 [38]: "Service-specific details for Mobile services". 
• ETSI TS 102 227 [i.1]: "Information flow and reference point definitions". 
• ETSI TS 101 909-20-1 [33]: "CMS based voice telephony services". 
• ETSI TS 101 909-20-2 [34]: "Services related to non-voice services".

 Figure 2: ETSI TS 102 232 [i.7] IP HO family 
Each standard in the ETSI TS 102 232 family [i.7] is published separately with individual version numbers, and may 
also define individually versioned ASN.1 modules. 
The present document identifies a set of versioned ASN.1 modules for service-specific details that may be used (see 
clauses A.1 and A.2). 
The complete relationship between the standards in the ETSI TS 102 232 family [i.7] (and of the relevant versioned 
ASN.1 modules) is summarized in annex H. 
4.4 Handover for GPRS/UMTS/EPS and 3GPP CS Domains 
4.4.1 PS Access 
Details for GPRS/UMTS/EPS PS are fixed within ETSI TS 133 108 [9]. 
However, it would be a standards compliant LI solution if a LEA, GPRS/UMTS/EPS PS domain operator and LI 
solution vendor came to an agreement to deploy HI port definitions laid down in the present document. 
4.4.2 Applications 
The interception of IMS-based services is specified in ETSI TS 102 232-5 [37] Service-specific details for IP 

Multimedia Services. Alternatively, details for 3GPP IMS-based VOIP/IMS Conference/PROSE/GCSE interception 

can be found in ETSI TS 133 108 [9].

Conference/PROSE/GCSE operator and LI solution vendor came to an agreement to deploy HI port definitions laid 

down in the present document. 
4.4.3 3GPP CS domain 
The interception of 3GPP CS domain is specified in ETSI TS 102 232-6 [36] Service-specific details for PSTN/ISDN or 

in ETSI TS 102 232-7 [38]. Alternatively, details for 3GPP CS Domain delivery in IP interception can be found in ETSI 

TS 133 108 [9]. 
However, it would be a standards compliant LI solution if a LEA, 3GPP CS operator and LI solution vendor came to an 
agreement to deploy HI port definitions laid down in the present document. 
4.5 Common parameters 
The service-specific details (SSD) describe how a service is intercepted. Some of these services may use the same 

technical parameters in the handover of intercepted inform
ation. To avoid duplication, these parameters have been 
defined in the ASN.1 of the present document. The SSD are responsible for allowing and describing the use of the 

common parameters within the context of the SSD. 
The following common parameter is available: 
• Location. 
5 Headers 
5.1 General 
All information sent over handover interfaces HI2 and HI3 shall be labelled with certain additional fields to allow the 
information to be identified, ordered, etc. This additional information will be called the "header" although in practice it 
could be added elsewhere (e.g. footer) or as part of an overall enveloping process. 
Clause 5 is mandatory for HI2 and HI3 information except where stated otherwise. 

The header fields are used to meet the following requirements in annex B: 
• R4 (LIID);
 • R5 and R7 (Communication Identifier);
 • R37 and R38 (Timestamp);
 • R15 and R19 (Sequence number);
 • R10 (Direction);
 • R9 (Payload type);
 • R8 (Interception Type).
 5.2 Description and purpose of the header fields 
5.2.1 Version 
The header shall state which version of the handover header is in use. 
NOTE: Some techniques (e.g. ASN.1 with BER) automatically include version numbering as part of the data 
encoding process. In these cases, it is not necessary to add a version number as a separate field. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)18 5.2.2 LIID 
See details in ETSI TS 103 280 [44], clause 6. 
5.2.3 Authorization country code 
The authorization country code states the country within
 which the authorization was granted. The authorization 
country code makes the LIID internationally unique. Two-letter codes are used as per ISO 3166-1 [10]. 
5.2.4 Communication identifier 
The communication identifier consists of the Network Id
entifier (NID), Communications Identity Number (CIN) and 
Delivery Country Code (DCC). 
The CIN is used to identify uniquely the communications session (as defined in ETSI TS 101 671 [4]). 

For some services, the CIN field defined in ETSI TS 101 671 [4] may not be sufficiently flexible to identify sessions 
uniquely and easily. The CIN extension field may be used, where permitted in the service specific standard (but shall 
not be used otherwise). The CIN shall then be considered 
to be the combination of communicationIdentityNumber field 
and the cINExtension field. If the CIN Extension Field in 
itself constitutes a unique identifier for the communications 
session, then the communicationIdentityNumber field does not need to be present. 
Each service-specific standard within the IP delivery handover framework of the present document shall contain a list of 
the events that trigger the start of a new communications sess
ion (i.e. the occasions when a new CIN shall be assigned). 
All the results of interception within a single communications session shall have the same CIN. If a single target 

identity has two or more communication sessions through the same operator, and through the same network element, 

then the CIN for each session shall be different. The CIN allows IRI and CC to be accurately associated and is 

mandatory for all HI2 and HI3 messages, with one exception. An IRI message may omit the CIN if it satisfies these 

three conditions: it is not related to any target communication session; it is not associated with any CC; it is not 

associated with any other IRI (for example, a target location message generated while no call is in progress may omit 

the CIN). 
The Network Identifier (NID) consists of the operator iden
tifier and, optionally, the network element. The operator 
identifier identifies the CSP performing the intercept and is
 mandatory. The network element identifier can be used 
within a CSP to identify the relevant network element carrying out the LI operations and is optional. If it is used, the 
network element needs to be uniquely identified within the CSP domain and either the networkElementIdentifier 

structure or the eTSI671NEID structure imported from ETSI TS 101 671 [4] needs to be used. 
The delivery country code makes the Communication Identifier internationally unique. The delivery country code 
identifies the geographical location of the Mediation Function. The DCC will be coded according to ISO 3166-1 [10]. 

The DCC should be used if MF and LEMF are not located in the same country. 
5.2.5 Sequence number 
The sequence number (as defined in ETSI TS 101 671 [4]) counts individual intercepted protocol data units within a 

communications session of a target identity. This means that the counts are separate for at least: 
• different sessions; 
• at different network elements; 
• for different target identities; 
• at different operators. 
In other words, counts are separate wherever the communication identifier or the LIID is different. 
The sequence number is restarted from zero each time a target begins a new communications session. Each 
service-specific standard within the ETSI TS 102 232 [i.7] framework shall contain a list of the events that trigger the 
start of a new communications session. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)19 NOTE: As a guide, the session starts at the time an IRI-BEGIN message would be sent and ends at the time an 
IRI-END would be sent. CC associated with a single IRI-REPORT message typically forms a single 
communications session in itself. Service-specific standards define when these IRI messages are sent. 

Under some circumstances (for example, through unexpected latencies or system errors), there may be 

IRI-REPORT messages which are part of a communi
cations session for which an IRI-END has already 
been sent. Similarly, there may be IRI-REPORT messages which are part of a session for which an 

IRI-BEGIN has not yet been sent. Such IRI-REPORTS should be assigned the same CIN as all other HI2 

and HI3 traffic in the same communications session. 
The sequence number shall increment sequentially by 1 each time a PS-PDU is generated by the MF for the 

communications session. 
The sequence number shall not exceed 2
32 - 1. The sequence number shall wrap to zero after 2
32 protocol data units 
have been counted in the session. 
The sequence number is required to preserve sequencing over the Handover Interface and to help identify missing data. 
It is mandatory for all interceptions where sessions can c
onsist of more than one protocol data unit. The sequence 
number is required in CC and IRI; the counting for IRI 
messages and CC shall be independent. The sequence number is 
required in certain TRI messages; the counting per TRI message class (such as "keep-alive", "integrityCheck", the 
option negotiation messages and "pDUAcknowledgementReques
t") shall be independent. Receivers can identify 
missing or out-of-order PS-PDUs by observing sequence numbers that do not increment sequentially by 1 with respect 

to the previous PS-PDU received for the communications session. 
5.2.6 Payload timestamp 
The timestamp is mandatory for IRI for all services. CC sh
all also contain a timestamp (exceptions are possible for CC 
timestamps on a service-by-service basis). 
NOTE 1: A PS header field is used to transfer the timestamp information specific for IRI and CC payloads; the 
transfer of the timestamp within each IRI and CC payload fields is strictly required only in case of 

aggregation of payloads (clause 6.2.3). 
NOTE 2: Either the ASN.1 GeneralizedTime or the ASN.1 MicroSecondTimeStamp may be used, subject to 
national agreement. 
NOTE 3: The timeStampQualifier field may be used to in
dicate what time the timestamp represents, subject to 
national agreement. 
NOTE 4: It is not recommended to use the payload timestamp for sequencing PDUs at the LEMF/LGW site. Refer 
to clause 5.2.5 for further guidelines on how sequencing may be implemented. 
5.2.7 Payload direction 
Indicates the direction of the intercepted data (to target or from target). The payload direction is optional for IRI; it shall
 only be used if specified in the service-specific details and shall only be used in the manner described in the 

service-specific details. The payload direction is optional for CC. 
5.2.8 Payload type 
It is mandatory to know whether the payload is IRI, CC, TRI, HI1 notification, or encrypted payload. 
TRI indicates that the payload contains information relating to the delivery of data to the LEA or the maintenance of 
transport connections between a DF and LGW. 
The TRI message types used between a CSP and LEA for notification of events are:  
• "integrityCheck" (clause 7.2.3);  
• "testPDU" (clause 7.3.1); 
• "firstSegmentFlag" and "lastSegmentFlag" (clause 6.2.4);  
• "cINReset" and "operatorLeaMessage" (clause 6.2.2). 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)20 The TRI message types used for the maintenance of 
a transport connection between a DF and LGW are: 
• "paddingPDU" (clause 6.2.5); 
• "keep-alive" and "keep-aliveResponse" (clause 6.3.4); 
• "optionRequest", "optionResponse", and "optionComplete" (clause 6.3.5); 
• "pDUAcknowledgementRequest" and "pDUAcknowledgementResponse" (clause 6.3.6). 
5.2.9 Interception type 
It is necessary to know the profile or further standard that
 was used in intercepting and formatting the data. Clause 4.3 
contains an explanation of additional standards that can be used in conjunction with this one. The list of valid 
interception types is given in annex A. 
5.2.10 IRI type 
The IRI type states whether a piece of IRI is a BEGIN, CONTINUE, END or REPORT message (see ETSI 

TS 101 671 [4]). The IRI-Type shall not be present unless the content of the PDU is IRI. The IRI-Type is 

MANDATORY for IRI messages except when the IRI content contains an explicit statement of the type of the IRI 

record. 
5.2.11 Interception Point Identifier 
The Interception Point Identifier is an optional field. If the Interception Point ID is used, the Service Provider shall 
assign each interception point within its network an identifier of
 up to 8 characters. The identifier shall be unique within 
the Service Provider. If used, the Inter
ception Point ID shall be attached to each
 CC and IRI PDU from that interception 
point. 
NOTE: The network element ID is used to distinguish be
tween different MFs within a CSP. It is possible that 
there is more than one interception point attached to each MF. In this situation, the Interception Point ID 
may be useful. 
The Interception Point Identifier is a standalone field that is completely independent of any other counters or numbering 

(e.g. sequence numbering is independent of Interception Point ID). 
5.2.12 Session direction 
The sessionDirection parameter for IRI messages is optional; it shall only be used if specified in the service-specific 

details and shall only be used in the manner described in the service-specific details. 
5.3 Encoding of header fields 
The transferred information shall conform to the Abstract
 Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) specification in annex A (as 
per Recommendation ITU-T X.680 [11]). 
The transferred messages are encoded to be binary co
mpatible with the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as per 
Recommendation ITU-T X.690 [12]. For more details see also ETSI TS 133 108 [9], clause B.1.

 6.2 Handover layer 
6.2.1 General 
The task of the Handover Manager (HM) is to handover intercepted data of all running intercepts to the appropriate 
destination(s). In order to do so, the Handover Manager creates minimally one Delivery Function (DF) (see clause 6.3) 

for each LEMF. For functional reasons or reasons of availability, multiple Delivery Functions associated with one 

LEMF may be created; each pointing to a different intermediate destination, a so called LEMF-Gateway (LGW). If 

LEMF-Gateways are used, the MF Handover Manager is responsible for distributing the PDUs over the appropriate 

LEMF-Gateway(s). Figure 4 depicts a possible use of the LEMF Gateway concept for increased availability.

Possible techniques for PDU distribution include (but are not limited to) the following: 
1) distribute PDUs randomly across all avai
lable DFs, e.g. for availability reasons; 
2) select a DF for the PDU on the basis of its LIID, e.g. for functional reasons; 
3) select a DF for the PDU on the basis of the intercepted service, e.g. for HI QoS differentiation; 

4) select a "standby" secondary DF, after failure of the connection to the primary DF; 

5) select randomly a DF across all available DFs for the delivery of all PDUs with the same LIID and CID, also 
after failure of the connection the selection randomly moves to another available DF.

if any, is to be agreed between CSP and LEA. 
HI1 (e.g. the warrant) can indicate the available DFs for the interception of the target. 

The Handover Manager is responsible for error reporting (see clause 6.2.2). 

The Handover Manager performs the following operations (in order moving down the protocol stack): 
• aggregate or segment/reassemble payloads if required (see clauses 6.2.3 and 6.2.4); 
• associate header information (see clause 5.2); 
• create padding PDUs if required (see clause 6.2.5); 
• perform integrity and encryption mechanism if required (see clauses 6.2.6, 7.2.3 and annex G); 
• assign PDUs to a Delivery Function. 
6.2.2 Error reporting 
The MF Handover Manager shall collect error reports from the lower layers at the CSP. It shall report errors to the 
LEMF Handover Manager according to agreements between the CSP and LEA. A TRI message of type 

OperatorLeaMessage may be used to transfer these error reports. 
The LEMF Handover Manager shall collect error reports from the lower layers at the LEA. 
If an MF system crash occurs and the CIN state and history is lost, both CIN and sequence numbers shall be reset to 
zero and a message shall be sent as TRI of type CINReset to indicate that subsequent numbering at the CIN level is not 

necessarily unique. The CINReset message shall have LIID set to a single "-" character (ASCII character 45); 

timestamp, operator and network element ID present and correct; CIN and sequence number set to zero. A CIN-Reset 

situation will cause numerous difficulties for downstream processing; if persistent storage is available, CSPs shall 

ensure their equipment is designed to avoid a loss of CIN state and history. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)23 Under certain circumstances, CIN state and history may be lost at the Mediation Function for a single LIID. Under these 
circumstances a CINReset message shall be sent and the LIID shall be set to the LIID in question, and shall include a 

timestamp, operator and network element ID. The sequence number shall be set to zero. The LEMF shall consider the 

CIN state and history for this LIID to be reset. When necessary because of implementation constraints, then, subject to 

agreement between the CSP and the LEA, this CINReset message shall be sent on all activations. 
6.2.3 Aggregation of payloads 
It may be beneficial to aggregate a number of payloads to be transported within one larger unit (Protocol Data Unit or 
PDU). The advantage is a saving in bandwidth (one PDU header covers a number of payloads). The main disadvantage 
is that some payloads are delayed while waiting for the aggregation to take place; additionally there is extra processing 

overhead. Payload aggregation may be used if agreed by th
e CSP and LEA. If payload aggregation is used, it shall be 
implemented as follows. 
To aggregate payloads, they may only have different timestamps, directions (for IRI or CC payloads) or IRI-types (for 
IRI payloads). Payloads may not be aggregated if their associ
ated information differs in other ways (e.g. different LIID, 
or different operator). One aggregated PDU then has a si
ngle sequence number (i.e. aggregated payloads are not 
assigned individual sequence numbers). The order of packets in the aggregated PDU shall be in the same sequence as 
they arrived at the Handover Manager. It is acceptable either to assign one timestamp to the whole PDU (in the PDU 

header) or, if more detailed timestamp information is required, then one timestamp shall be assigned to each payload as 

indicated in annex A. A "timeStampQualifier" in each payload can be used to indicate what this timestamp represents. 
An additional timestamp may be assigned to the PDU header to indicate when the aggregated PDU was created. In this 
case the value "timeOfAggregation" shall be the time the complete PDU is created. 
The implementation of aggregation (i.e. when aggregation is applied, use of "timeStampQualifier", and how many 
packets can be aggregated together) shall be subject to the agreement of CSP and LEA to meet national requirements. 
6.2.4 Sending a large block of application-level data 
When a large self-contained block of application-level data has to be transferred over the HI, in order not to choke the 

connection to the LEMF for a prolonged period of time, the data may be divided over multiple PDUs. Alternatively, in 

order to avoid congestion, multiple LEMF Gateways (LGWs) may be used towards a single destination if agreed by the 

CSP and the LEA. 
If segmentation is applied, the application-level data is divided into smaller segments and each segment is sent as 
CC-payload with its own set of header-fields, where, as for regular PDUs, the sequence number increments for each 

PDU being sent. 
Before transfer of the first PDU containing a segment of the application-data, the DF shall send a TRI of the type 
"FirstSegmentFlag", containing a header with a communication 
identifier, an authorization country code, an LIID and a 
sequence number identical to the of the first data PDU being sent. Timestamp should not be present. 
After sending the last segment of the application-data the DF shall send a TRI of the type "LastSegmentFlag", 
containing a header with a communication identifier, an 
authorization country code, an LIID and a sequence number 
identical to that of the last data PDU being sent. Timestamp should not be present. 
NOTE 1: The header values of the two TRIs (the sequence numbers in particular) will allow the LEMF to 
reassemble the segmented data. 
NOTE 2: The minimum size of data to be divided over multiple PDUs is not defined; it depends on the details of 
the transport connection, such as the bandwidth, utilization and the required timeliness of other events 

such as HI2. 
6.2.5 Padding data 
By agreement, it is permitted to transfer "padding" data ov
er the Handover Interface. The purpose of padding data is to 
change the data flow rate to prevent analysis of patterns in data flows. If required, padding data shall be created at the 

MF Handover Manager and shall be removed by the LEMF Handover Manager. The padding data shall be sent as 
Transport-Related Information of type Padding-PDU (see annex A for details). The PDU shall have correct Object ID, 
Operator ID and (optionally) Network Element ID but all other 
fields shall contain any value. There is no constraint on 
the payload contents, although a Padding-PDU shall not be used to carry meaningful data. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)24 6.2.6 Payload encryption 
In some cases, up to national agreement, it is necessary to en
crypt the individual intercepted PDUs to meet requirements 
R26 and R29. In those cases a method for encryption and key management is agreed upon between CSP and LEA. The 

ASN.1 encryptedPayload structure shall be used for 
transport of the encrypted ASN.1 Payload structure. 
When payload encryption is implemented, the guidelines as documented in annex G shall be used. 
6.3 Session layer 
6.3.1 General 
The Delivery Function is responsible for maintaining a single transport connection as described in clause 6.3.2. The 

transport connection can be a TCP socket, a TLS IETF RFC 5246 [21] session or other transport connection. When 

using TLS, a TCP socket is opened by TLS. TCP details ar
e given in clause 6.4; the specification for other transport 
connections is outside the scope of the present document. 
The Delivery Function performs the following operations (in order moving down the protocol stack): 
• Perform the "keep-alive" mechanism if required (see clause 6.3.4). 
• Encode/decode PDU elements (see clause 5.3). 
• Buffer data (see clause 6.3.3). 
6.3.2 Opening and closing connections 
When it is created, the MF Delivery Function shall immediatel
y attempt to open a transport connection. It is acceptable 
for the MF or LEMF Delivery Function to terminate the trans
port connection if they require.
 If the transport connection 
terminates for any reason, the MF Delivery Function shall immediately attempt to reopen it. 
If the attempt to open a connection is not successful, the MF Delivery Function shall continue to attempt to open the 
transport connection with a configurable time interval (e.g. 30 s) between attempts (i.e. between the indication of failure 

of the previous attempt and initiation of new attempt). Failure to open a transport connection shall be reported to the MF 

Handover Manager. 
NOTE: Under some circumstances (e.g. if there are extended periods with no data to be sent and there are costs 
associated with maintaining a transport connectio
n) it is also acceptable to operate the transport 
connection on an "as required" basis. This means that if the transport connection was closed down by the 

MF or LEMF in a controlled and error-free manner, it should not be re-opened until there is further data 

to be transported. If "keep-alives" are still required while the connection is still closed, the connection 

should be re-established. 
6.3.3 Buffering 
It is required that no data is lost due to unexpected termination of the transport connection and that no traffic is dropped 

during very short system outages. Therefore the MF Delivery Function shall be able to buffer traffic for short periods. 
In order to do so, each Delivery Function keeps a 
cyclic buffer
. When a PDU is received by the Delivery Function, if a 
transport connection is open, the PDU is sent to the open connection. If the PDU is not a TRI "keep-alive", related to 
option negotiation, or a TRI "pDUAcknowledgementRequest", it will also be written to the cyclic buffer. The transport 

connection returns information on how much data it successfully sent and, using the FIFO principle, the Delivery 

Function deletes the PDUs from the buffer that fit into that amount of data. The Delivery Function will only accept 

PDUs for transport if there is room for them in the cyclic buffer. If the buffer becomes full, the Delivery Function 
reports this to the Handover Manager; the Delivery Function then discards data by overwriting the oldest data in the 
buffer. 
NOTE 1: If TCP is used, the cyclic buffer size should minimally be that of the TCP send buffer and should cover 
the time it takes to re-start a TCP connection. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)25 Whenever a transport connection is re-opened, once the 
transport connection is re-established, the MF Delivery 
Function will resynchronize
 the data 
by re-sending the PDUs that are still stored in the cyclic buffer before any new 
data is transferred. 
NOTE 2: Since it is uncertain whether the data in the buffer was delivered or not, the LEMF should be able to deal 
with duplicate delivery of PDUs. 
If PDU acknowledgement is enabled (see clause 6.3.6), this can be used to reliably determine which PDUs in the buffer 
may be deleted. 
If data has to be discarded and the Integrity mechanism defined in clause 7.2.3 is being used, all HI2 information shall 
be dropped before discarding any IntegrityCheck PDUs. 
Buffering to cover longer outages is outside the scope of the present document. 
6.3.4 Keep-alives 
To meet requirement R16 (see annex B) it is recommended 
to use session-layer "keep-alives". If used, "keep-alives" 
shall be implemented as described in this clause. 
The MF Delivery Function starts a timer when the connection is established, and is reset whenever data is sent. When 
the timer reaches TIME1, the MF Delivery Function shall 
send a "keep-alive" message. It is acceptable for the 
"keep-alive" message to be sent before TIME1 if required. The LEMF Delivery Function shall respond to this 

"keep-alive" message within TIME2. If the MF does not receive a response in TIME3, the MF shall terminate the 

connection at the Transport Layer and attempt to establish a new one. 
NOTE: The CSP and the LEA should agree on values for TIME1, 2 and 3. A typical value for TIME1 would 
range from 120 s to 360 s. A typical value for TIME2 would be 30 s. The value for TIME3 should be long 

enough to allow for the transport connection to recover from transient failures (e.g. to cover TCP 

retransmissions including exponential back-off). A typical value for TIME3 would be 60 s. Note that 

TIME3 will need to be larger than TIME2. 
The "keep-alive" message is sent as Transport-Related Information of type "keep-alive" (see annex A for details). The 
sequence number increments for each "keep-alive" sent within the same instance of the Delivery Function. The 
timestamp and domain ID shall be set appropriately. All other header fields shall be filled in with any value. The 

"keep-alive" response message is sent as TRI, of type "keep-alive" Response. The sequence number of the response is 

the sequence number of the "keep-alive" PDU that generated the response. The timestamp shall be updated to the 

appropriate value by the LEMF Delivery Function. All other header fields shall be filled in with any value. 
6.3.5 Option negotiation 
6.3.5.1 Introduction 
The "option negotiation" mechanism allows for the DF to negotiate transport layer and session layer options with the 
LGW in a manner that is backwards compatible with existing implementations as well as supporting future options. 
Option negotiation is only initiated from the DF, yet either endpoint may request options from its peer during the option 

negotiation process. After the negotiation has completed, successfully negotiated options may then result in messages 

that originate from either the DF or the LGW, depending upon the option's requirements, for the duration of the session. 

Renegotiation during the same session is not supported. 
Option negotiation is implemented as TRI message types: 
• The type "Option" is an extensible choice, with an id
entifier per option. Each option may be a different type 
within "Option" with option-specific request parameters and/or response parameters as required. Options shall 
only apply to transport layer and session layer behaviour, and not apply to PDU formatting or what is 

intercepted. 
• The "optionRequest" message is an extensible sequ
ence containing "requestedOptions". The identifier 
"requestedOptions" contains options that the endpoint is requesting from its peer. Each "optionRequest" 
message replaces any previously requested state in the peer during the current option negotiation. At most, 
only one "optionRequest" may be outstanding from an endpoint at any time. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)26 • The "optionResponse" message is an extensib
le sequence containing "acceptedOptions" and 
"declinedOptions". The identifier "accep
tedOptions" contains requested options that the endpoint supports and 
will enable once option negotiation is complete, and 
the identifier "d
eclinedOptions" contains requested 
options that the endpoint is aware of (in the standard) but does not support. If a requested option is not present 
in either "acceptedOptions" or "declin
edOptions" then this indicates that the endpoint is not aware of the 
option in the version of the specification that it uses. The "optionResponse" shall only contain a subset of the 

requested options. 
• The "optionComplete" message indicates that the endpoint
 is satisfied with the mo
st recent "acceptedOptions" 
that have been accepted by the peer and that no 
further negotiation is required from the endpoint. 
Future options may be additional identifiers in TRI messages, or extensions to other message types. 
6.3.5.2 Option negotiation message exchange 
After the establishment of the connection, the DF first se
nds a TRI "optionRequest" message containing the requested 
options (if any) and a sequence number that is incremented for each "optionRequest" or "optionComplete" sent over the 

same transport connection from that endpoint. A TRI "keep-alive" message (see clause 6.3.4) should be sent as the next 

message to enable responsive negotiation termination with LGWs that do not support option negotiation. The 

implementation of TRI "keep-alive" is mandatory if option negotiation is required. 
The LGW shall respond to the received "optionRequest" messa
ge with a TRI "optionResponse" message containing the 
accepted and declined options, using the same sequence num
ber as the received "optionRequest". The LGW then 
responds to the TRI "keep-alive" with a "keep-aliveResponse". 
The LGW sends either an "optionRequest" to initiate its 
desired negotiation, or an "optionComplete" to indicate that it does not require (further) negotiation. The sequence 
numbers used for option negotiation are independent of those used by other TRI messages (such as "keep-alive" and 

"IntegrityCheck"). The sequence numbers used by the LGW fo
r option negotiation are independent of those used by the 
DF. The endpoints shall process and respond to TRI messages in 
the order received on the transport connection. If the DF 
first receives a TRI "keep-aliveResponse", this indicates that the LGW does not support option negotiation and has 
ignored the "optionRequest" that the DF sent. No further negotiation shall occur; option negotiation is terminated. 
Otherwise, the DF should have received a TRI "optionR
esponse", containing the accepted and declined options. The 
next message received should be one of: 
• A TRI "optionRequest", which indicates that the LGW wants to perform negotiation. The DF should respond 
to this appropriately. Option negotiation is still in progress from both endpoints. 
• A TRI "optionComplete", which indicates that the LGW has finished negotiation. Option negotiation may still 

occur from the DF. 
At this point, the DF may complete its negotiation with "optionComplete", or send another "optionRequest" message. 

Option negotiation is complete when an endpoint has both sent
 an "optionComplete" message and received one from its 
peer. At that point, normal message exchange may occur, 
using the most recently accepted options for the duration of 
the transport connection. 
If an endpoint receives messages other than those relating
 to the option negotiation m
echanism before the endpoint 
considers that the negotiation mechanism is complete, the connection shall be terminated. The endpoint shall not use 
any accepted options until optio
n negotiation is complete. The endpoint shall not use option negotiation messages after 
option negotiation is complete. If an endpoint receives options
 other than those successfully negotiated, the option may 
be ignored or the connection may be terminated. 
Option negotiation is subject to agreement between the CSP and LEA to meet national requirements, including: 
• support for the option negotiation mechanism; 
• support for specific options; 
• overall timeout of the option negotiation process; 
• reconnection behaviour if the connection is terminated due to a failure during negotiation (e.g. immediate retry 
with negotiation enabled, immediate retry with negotiatio
n disabled, back-off interval before retry, or raise 

alarms and disable reconnection); and 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)27 • specific error handling for unaccepted options after negotiation is complete. 
Example message exchanges are provided in annex I. 
6.3.6 PDU acknowledgement 
The use of TCP does not guarantee that all PDU data transmitted by the DF is received and processed by the LGW (see 
clauses 6.3.3 and 6.4.3). To improve the reliability, session layer PDU acknowledgement may be used over the transport 

connection.  
The DF may send a "pDUAcknowledgementRequest" TRI message to request that the LGW acknowledge all PDUs up 
to this message for this session have been received and processed. The LGW shall respond with a 
"pDUAcknowledgementResponse" message within TIME4 to acknowledge that PDUs up to the 

"pDUAcknowledgementRequest" have been processed (possibly with persistence, depending upon national agreement). 

The DF can discard buffered data sent before the "pDUAcknowledgementRequest" that matches the 

"pDUAcknowledgementResponse". If the DF does not receive a response in TIME5, the DF shall terminate the 
connection at the Transport Layer and attempt a new one, and assume that all unacknowledged data needs to be 
retransmitted. 
NOTE 1: The interval, TIME6, between "pDUAcknowledgementRequest" messages should be selected relative to 
the size of the DF buffer and the expected throughput of the connection; a value that is too small (such as 

per CC PDU in high throughput situations) may result in too much processing load by the peers, and 

value that is too large would negate the purpose of PDU acknowledgement. 
NOTE 2: The CSP and the LEA should agree on values for TIME4, TIME5, and TIME6. A typical value for 
TIME4 would be 30 s. The value for TIME5 should be long enough to allow for the transport connection 

to recover from transient failures (e.g. to cover TCP retransmissions including exponential back-off). A 

typical value for TIME5 would be 60 s. Note that TIME5 will need to be larger than TIME4. 
The "pDUAcknowledgementRequest" message is sent as TRI type "pDUAcknowledgementRequest". The sequence 

number increments for each "pDUAcknowledgementRequest" sent within the same instance of the DF. The timestamp 
and domain ID shall be set appropriately. All other header fields shall be filled in with any value valid for that ASN.1 
type. The "pDUAcknowledgementResponse" message is sent as TRI type "pDUAcknowledgementResponse". The 

sequence number of the "pDUAcknowledgementResponse" is the sequence number of the 

"pDUAcknowledgementRequest" that generated the response. The timestamp shall be updated to the appropriate value 

by the LGW. All other header fields shall be filled in with any value valid for that ASN.1 type, although it is 

recommended that these are copies of the values from the request. 
Depending upon national agreement, the use of PDU acknowledgement is controlled via either: 
1) the PDU acknowledgement option "pDUAcknowledgeme
nt" successfully negotiated for each transport 
connection (see clause 6.3.5); or 
2) required implementation in an endpoint. This use does not need option negotiation. 
6.4 Transport layer 
6.4.1 Introduction 
Clause 6.4 describes a transport layer that is based on th
e Transport Control Protocol. TCP is implemented according to 
IETF RFC 793 [16], IETF RFC 5681 [23], IETF RFC 6298 [27] and clause 4.2 of IETF RFC 1122 [17]. The MF is the 
TCP sender and the LEMF is the TCP receiver. 
6.4.2 TCP settings 
The source and destination port numbers shall be within the dynamic port range for TCP. The value of the source port 

number is chosen by the CSP. The allocation of the destination port number is outside the scope of the present 

document. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)28 TCP "keep-alive" (IETF RFC 1122 [17]) should not be used. If "keep-alives" are required, they should be sent at the 
session layer (see clause 6.3.4). 
NOTE: Annex C provides further guidance on setting up and tuning TCP. 
6.4.3 Acknowledging data 
The Delivery Function shall be informed when data has been successfully sent. One of the following three options shall 

be chosen: 
1) Data is considered to be successfully sent 
once TCP-acknowledgements have been received. 
2) Data is considered to be successfully sent once a further N kB of data has passed through the TCP socket 

(where N is the size of the TCP send buffer). 
3) Data is considered to be successfully sent as
 soon as it is passed to an open TCP socket. 
Under option 2, when the transport connection is operated on an "as required" basis (see clause 6.3.2), the transport 

connection may be closed: if the keep-alive mechanism is being used (see clause 6.3.4) and after M minutes (typical 
value 15 minutes) have passed without transport-related errors occurring; or the PDU acknowledgement mechanism is 
being used (see clause 6.3.6) and a successful PDU acknowledgement message exchange has occurred. These 

conditions should ensure that the data is received at the LEMF. 
Under option 3 some data may be lost during network outage
s; option 3 is only acceptable subject to the agreement of 
the CSP and LEA. 
6.5 Network layer 
The Network layer implements the Internet Protocol according to IETF RFC 791 [14]. 
7 Delivery networks 
7.1 Types of network 
7.1.1 General 
The network used for data exchange influences how the handover requirements from annex B should be met. The 
choice of the network will be made on a national basis for legal and pragmatic reasons. 
This clause orders the networks in three generic categories 
to consider their influence on the implementation of the 
requirements in the data exchange. 
7.1.2 Private networks 
The first category of networks, private networks, is dedicated for one task (or a limited set of tasks) only. The access 

control is limited to the involved LEA and CSP. 
Accidental access to content or access points by third parties is
 possible by static configuration failures. It is possible 
but very unlikely. Active access by third parties is possible by brute force or physical intrusion. 
A typical example of a private network is leased lines. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)29 7.1.3 Public networks 
with strict control 
This second category of networks is public networks under strong control of the CSP offering this network service. 
The network facilities give rather strong protection agai
nst access to content or access points by third parties. 
Accidental access is possible due to configuration or addr
essing mistakes. The opportunities for active access by third 
parties depend mainly on the order of management and reliability of the network (back doors) or brute force. 
A typical example of a public network with strict control is the public X.25 network. 
7.1.4 Public networks with loose control 
The third category of networks is public networks with very little control by the CSP offering the network as to who 
communicates with whom. 
The network provides open communication between endpoints with very loose control over access to the network. This 
provides little inherent protection from acce
ss to an endpoint by any other endpoint. 
A typical example of a public network with loose control is the Internet. 
7.2 Security requirements 
7.2.1 General 
In annex B, requirements are identified for Confidentiality, Authentication and Integrity. These requirements can be met 

by use of a private, managed delivery mechanism (clause 7.1.2). However, if the underlying mechanism is based on a 

public network (clauses 7.1.3 and 7.1.4), then further security mechanisms are strongly recommended. 
The requirements for Confidentiality, Authentication and Handover Integrity can be met by using a VPN application. 
VPN applications provide secure, network-to-network, host-to-network, or host-to-host tunnels - virtual point-to-point 
connections. The technical details for the VPN applications
 including IPSec are outside the scope of the present 
document. 
Alternatively the requirements for confidentiality, authentication and integrity can be addressed as described in 
clauses 7.2.2 and 7.2.3. 
7.2.2 Confidentiality and authentication 
To support the requirement for confidentiality (requirement R26) and authentication (requirement R28), the 

recommended technology is to use TLS IETF RFC 5246 [21]. TLS is applied at the Transport Layer, instead of opening 

a TCP socket (clause 6.4.2), a TLS session is opened. The TLS session opens its own, single TCP socket. 
TLS implementations shall follow the recommendations in IETF RFC 7525 [41]. 
X.509 certificates IETF RFC 6818 [30] should be used for authentication as described in IETF RFC 5246 [21]. 
7.2.3 Integrity 
Up to national agreement, in order to a
llow the authorities to verify the integrity of the received intercepted data, the 
Handover Manager periodically may insert hash based message digests into the data stream. To be able to prove the 
integrity and authenticity of these hash based message digests, periodically a digitally signed message digest may be 

inserted as well.  
If integrity checks are used they shall be impl
emented according to the guidelines in annex J. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)30 7.3 Further delivery requirements 
7.3.1 Test data 
To meet requirement R17, the network and/or the data exchange mechanisms shall have the possibility to transfer  
Test-PDUs. Test data should be sent end-to-end (from the CSP interception point to the LEA data viewing point) where 

possible. The test PDUs should be transferred at the activa
tion of the intercept and may be transferred at other times. 
The Test-PDU is sent as Transport Related Information (TRI) (see annex A for details). Appropriate values shall be 

filled in for LIID, Country Code, Communications Identifier and Timestamp. Sequence number shall be set to zero. 
7.3.2 Timeliness 
The timeliness requirement is that the results of interception are not delayed unnecessarily (R14), with no requirement 

to preserve the real-time nature of CC in LI delivery. Under normal conditions, all the network types in clause 6.2 will 

meet this timeliness requirement when using the delivery mechanism in clause 7. 
NOTE: Under conditions of heavy loading the performance of TCP can degrade. The LEA and CSP should 
consider transporting the time-critical traffic on a separate, managed network. The network should have 

sufficient bandwidth and should meet suitable performance criteria.

The present document is designed to transport CC and IRI from a range of different services. Consequently, it imports 
CC and IRI structures from a number of other standards. If only one service is being used, it might be inconvenient to 

import CC and IRI structures from all of the other service-specific standards. It is acceptable to comment out (i.e. add "-

-" to the start of the corresponding lines) any IMPORTS statements that are not being used. The corresponding 

alternatives of the CHOICEs within IRI Payload and CC Payload structures should then also be commented out.

-10)43 Annex B (informative): 
Requirements 
B.1 Types of intercepted information 
R1) The interface has to be able to handover communications content in the form of: 
• one or more datagrams (as per IETF RFC 791 [14] or IETF RFC 8200 [22]); 
• one or more application level PDUs (e.g. messages conforming to IETF RFC 5321 [24] or IETF 
RFC 6854 [25]). 
R2) The interface has to be able to handover: 
• Intercept-Related Information associated with the CC noted above; 
• Intercept-Related Information which is not associated with CC (i.e. the interface should support IRI-only 

interception; see ETSI TS 101 671 [4], clause 7.1.4). 
R3) The handover interface has to be flexible and extensible. 
B.2 Identification of traffic 
R4) The results of interception have to be (international
ly) uniquely associated with a target identity (ETSI 
TS 101 671 [4], clause 6.1, ETSI TS 101 331 [1], clauses 4.2, f) and 4.10, f)). For security reasons, it has to be 

possible to make this association without explicitly adding the target identity to the results of interception. 
R5) When IRI relates to CC, then such IRI has to be associated with the relevant CC (ETSI TS 101 331 [1], 
clause 4.10, g), ETSI ES 201 158 [2], clause 5.6). 
R6) It has to be possible to distinguish between multiple communications from the same target identity (ETSI 
TS 101 671 [4], clause 6.2). This includes the following cases: 
• two communications sessions which overlap in time (e
.g. target is logged on twice to an internet access 
provider); 
• two "single-shot" communications occurring almost simultaneously (e.g. target receives two emails within a 

very short space of time). 
R7) The parties involved in the exchange of information (CSP and LEMF) can be identified uniquely on an 
international basis (ETSI ES 201 158 [2], clause 4.3.1). 
R8) The handover interface has to contain a parameter indicating the service being intercepted. 
R9) IRI and CC have to be differentiated. 

R10) The handover interface has to indicate whether intercep
ted CC was travelling to or from the target (or that the 
direction was indeterminate). 
B.3 Performance 
R11) The HI2 delivery mechanism has to support an appropriate minimum sustained traffic rate. 

R12) The HI3 delivery mechanism has to support an appropriate minimum sustained traffic rate. 
R13) The handover interface has to accommodate multiple LEMFs (ETSI ES 201 158 [2], clause A.2). 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)44 B.4 Timeliness 
R14) The handover interface has not to delay the results of interception unnecessarily (for more details see ETSI 
TS 101 671 [4], clauses 8 and 10.1, ETSI TS 101 331 [1], clause 4.5, d) and ETSI ES 201 158 [2], clause 5.4). 
NOTE: There is no requirement to preserve the real-time nature of CC in LI delivery such as that required by 
interactive multimedia applications (e.g. see ETSI TS 123 107 [i.3]). Priority is given to the reliable 
delivery of data. 
R15) The handover interface has to support the preservation of the sequencing of the PDUs. 
B.5 Reliability and availability 
R16) CSP and LEMF have to be able to detect when the transfer of IRI or CC is unavailable (ETSI TS 101 671 [4], 
clause D.4) and have to provide fault reports (ETSI ES 201 158 [2], clause 7.2). 
R17) It should be possible to test the correct operation of the lawful interception functionality and HI (ETSI 
ES 201 158 [2], clause 5.7). 
R18) The interface has to be reliable (ETSI TS 101 331 [1], 
clauses 4.2, b), 3), ETSI TR 101 944 [i.4], clause 8.2). 
R19) Under normal operating conditions, each and every P
DU has to be transferred unaltered across the interface. 
R20) The protocols adopted have to be resilient to transmission impairment. 
B.6 Discarding information 
R21) IRI has not to be discarded during transport mechanism outages for a negotiated period (see also ETSI 
ES 201 158 [2], clause 5.4, ETSI TS 101 331 [1], clause 4.2, b), 3)). 
R22) Order of discarding information: all HI3 information should be dropped before discarding any HI2. 
R23) For connection-oriented protocols, CC has to be buffer
ed to cover transient link failure, subject to capacity and 
security limitations (e.g. there has to be CC buffering to cover the time it takes to establish a connection). 
R24) CC has to be buffered to cover longer link failures if required nationally (ETSI TS 101 331 [1], clause 4.2, b), 
4)). 
R25) The HI2 and HI3 (logical) link have the ability to consist of one or more paths/routes if required nationally. 
B.7 Security 
NOTE: Security at CSP and LEMF (e.g. 
of security clearance of CSPs own staf
f, physical security at LEMF, etc.) 
is outside the scope of the present document. A full security analysis (e.g. threat model) is beyond the 
scope of the present document. 
R26) The handover interface has to support confidentiality (ETSI ETR 232 [i.6], ETSI TR 101 944 [i.4], clauses 7.1 
and 8.2, ETSI TS 101 331 [1], clause 4.7, j)). 
R27) The handover interface has to support measures to prove th
e integrity of transported data. It has to be possible to 
incorporate techniques that identify if data has been added, removed or altered (ETSI ETR 232 [i.6], ETSI 

TS 101 331 [1], clauses 4.2, b), 3) and 4.2, b), 4)). 
R28) The interface has to support the establishment of
 the communicating identities in each direction (ETSI 
TS 101 331 [1], clauses 4.7, g), 4.7, h) and 4.7, i), ETSI ES 201 158 [2], clause 8.3 and ETSI TR 101 944 [i.4], 

clause 7.1). 
R29) Nothing within the handover interface should compromise national security.
   ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)45 B.8 Other R30) The interface has to be based upon open, standard
ized and widely-used data 
communication protocols and 
coding principles (ETSI TS 101 671 [4], clauses 5.2 and 8.1). 
R31) The interface has to support the use of generally-available transmission paths (ETSI TS 101 331 [1], 
clauses 4.10, e) and 4.10, h)). 
R32) The interface has to be designed to be low in cost 
(for specification, design, implementation, verification and 
testing, configuration and adaptation at CSP and LEA). 
R33) The standard should contain a minimum of choices and options. 
R34) The standard should use all applicable details from ETSI TS 101 671 [4]. 

R35) The interface should be capable of
 ready adaptation to national requiremen
ts (ETSI TS 101 331 [1], clause 4.1, 
ETSI ES 201 158 [2], clause 4.2). 
R36) The interface should support the delivery of the result of
 interception between an opera
tor's technical facility in 
one country and an LEMF in another. 
R37) All IRI has to contain a timestamp (ETSI TS 101 671 [4], clause 8). 

R38) CC has to in general contain timestamps; exceptions are possible on service-by-service basis. 

R39) The interface should do nothing to prejudice the intr
oduction of the result of interception passed across it as 
evidence in a court of law. 
R40) The interface should be able to support any necessa
ry mechanisms that may be required to support the 
introduction of the result of interception passed across it as evidence in a court of law. 
R41) Delivery Functions (DF) and Handover Managers (HM) within a CSP domain should use clock synchronization 
(e.g. Network Time Protocol (NTP) or Global Positioning System (GPS)).

-10)46 Annex C (informative): 
Notes on TCP tuning 
C.1 Implement IETF RFC 5681 
It is recommended to deploy a TCP stack, both at the send
ing and receiving end of the connection, that implements 
IETF RFC 5681 [23]. This RFC defines, amongst others, "fast retransmit" and "fast recovery" options, which greatly 
improve performance in case of packet-loss or network congestion. 
C.2 Minimize roundtrip times 
It is recommended to optimize the network connection betw
een MF and the LEMF especially in terms of roundtrip 
time. The TCP Roundtrip Time (RTT) is the elapsed time between sending a data octet with a particular sequence 

number and receiving an acknowledgement that covers that sequence number, i.e. in every RTT, data of the size of the 

window size can be transported. Thus, with a window size of 64 kB and a RTT of 20 ms, the throughput is about 

3,28 Mbyte/s (or 26 Mbit/s). 
C.3 Enable maximum segment size option 
It is recommended to deploy a TCP stack, both at the send
ing and receiving end of the connection, that supports the 
Maximum Segment Size (MSS) option and follows the usage defined in clause 4.2.2.6 of IETF RFC 1122 [17]. This 
allows the receiver to announce the maximum size of the TCP 
data segments it can receive. If the receiver is connected 
using Ethernet, and the underlying IP layer allows for it, the announced Segment size will typically be 1 460 bytes. If 
the MSS is not announced, the sender reverts to the default segment size of 536 bytes (the default IP datagram size of 

576 bytes minus 40 bytes for IP and TCP header). 
C.4 Path MTU discovery 
The MF may utilize Path MTU Discovery IETF RFC 1191 [19].
 This allows the MF to discover the largest possible 
packet size for the session. The issues discussed in IETF RFC 2923 [26] should be taken into account if Path MTU 

Discovery is used. 
For Path MTU Discovery to work, all network equipment in the path between the MF and the LEMF has to be able to 
forward and/or generate Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) IETF RFC 792 [15] "too big" packets. If this is not 

the case, the MF has to be able to function without Path MTU Discovery. 
NOTE: Internet Control Message Protocol packets are often blocked on firewalls for security reasons. 
C.5 Selective acknowledgement 
It is recommended to utilize TCP SACK IETF RFC 2018 [20]
 to improve the efficiency of TCP in the face of 
congestion and for high bandwidth links. 
C.6 High speed options 
If the link between the MF and LEMF has a high bandwidth 
× delay product, the MF and LEMF may utilize the Large 
Windows option defined in IETF RFC 7323 [18]. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)47 C.7 PUSH flag 
If the application uses the PUSH flag, it should follow the recommendations in clause 4.2.2.2 of IETF RFC 1122 [17]. 
C.8 Nagle's algorithm 
To reduce the transmission delay experienced by small pack
ets, it is recommended to turn off Nagle's algorithm. 
NOTE: The TCP socket option named TCP_NODELAY is prov
ided for enabling or disabling Nagle's algorithm. 
This Boolean option is set to TRUE to disable Nagle's algorithm. 
C.9 Buffer size 
It is recommended to configure TCP, on both the MF and 
LEMF, with a send/receive buffer size that is at least the 
bandwidth 
× delay product of the link.
 The window size used by TCP will typically equal the size of the receive buffer. 
In case of overrun of the receiving party, sender and receiver will autonomously negotiate a smaller window. The Large 
Windows option in IETF RFC 7323 [18] has to be used if a window size larger than 64 K/bytes is to be used. On the 

other hand, if a low bandwidth link is being used between the MF and LEMF (e.g. dial-up modem), reducing the 

receive buffer (e.g. to 8 K) can increase the effi
ciency and decrease the latency in the connection.

-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)48 Annex D (informative): 
IRI-only interception 
D.1 Introduction 
In certain countries it is easier to obtain lawful authorizations for HI2-only intercepts in other situations these lawful 
authorizations are considered for proportionality. If lawful authorizations allow only HI2 traffic, then the precise 

definitions of HI2 and HI3 are clearly important. 
This annex focuses on IP as target service (not email, etc.). 
D.2 Definition HI information 
As an example of one country operating under this system the following definitions are used: 
IRI: Dialling, signalling or addressing information that identifies the origin, direction, destination or termination of 
each communication generated or received by the subscriber by means of any equipment, facility or service of 
a service provider. This includes, but is not limited to, parameters of the signalling information that can be 

used as a means to subscribe to or activate features 
of the service, or establis
h and control a communication 
attempt. 
CC: Any information concerning the substance, purport or meaning of that communication. 
In general IP based networks have facilities to generate the HI2 as described above. 
D.3 IRI deriving 
In practice the facilities that generate the IRI information are not always switched on or network wide activated. A 

major reason seems to be the chance they influence the performance of the network element in busy moments if 

activated broadly. This could than influence the overall network performance (quality). 
Another aspect of HI2 in IP-networks is that more or less al
l networks element could be involved in the traffic of one 
user. The configuration of network element in a network is 
less hierarchical and more autonomous distributed then in 
circuit switched networks costing the co
llection of IRI information more effort. 
Although the information is available in the network it might not always be desirable to derive and collect the 
information there. 
In IP-networks almost each network element that passes through traffic has access to most of the IRI information of that 
traffic. This means HI3 has the opportunity to access the HI2 information, IRI as well. 
The log on, log off and mobility management are in most situations handled in the networks as IRI from the start and 
delivered to the mediator to 
be delivered via HI2 directly. 
This concludes that the major set of IRI information can gained from: 
a) Primary network elements involved in the communication. 
b) The traffic itself for instance as it is passing through the HI3. 
The decision where this is done depends on network issues and national requirements. Combinations of both are likely 

to be needed to cover the needs. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)49 D.4 IRI by post and pre-processing HI3 information 
This clause focuses the deriving of IRI by the HI3 for IP-access only (not email). 
The handover interface and so HI3 has two sides: the CSP or mediator side and the LEA or LEMF side. 

Deriving the IRI from the HI3 information can therefore be done by post processing at the mediator or pre-processing at 
the law enforcement monitoring facility. 
NOTE: The terms "pre" and "post" have been chosen from the perspective of the law enforcement domain and the 
perspective of the providers' domain. After the mediator has done its normal processing to create HI3 

information additional post processing is needed to generate HI2 information and to discard the HI3 

information. Similar at the LEMF before the HI3 in
formation enters the normal process of storage and 
interpretation pre-processing has to take place to generate the HI2 information and discard the HI3 

information. 
Legal systems can allow for pre-processing. Details are not relevant for the scope of the present document as they can 

be dealt with in the law enforcement domain. 
Not all countries would allow for this solution particularly as initially all information is sent. 

If post processing is required the level of processing influences the performance of the mediator and legal use of the 
information. An exchange can be made here on a national basis. 
Taking the effort as an important parameter the post processing could be done in different ways like: 
1) Fixed header length assumption. 
2) Protocol headers extraction. 
3) Strict IRI extraction. 

4) Blanking payload. 
It is a national mainly legal issue to allow for one or 
more of these options. Some 
considerations for each option 
include: 
1) Protocol headers have dynamic lengths. Assuming a certain length minimizes the processing power needed but 
can give incomplete headers in some cases and clippings of content in other cases. 
2) There is more processing power needed here. Especially
 if not only the IP-header but also the next protocol 
(TCP/UDP or other) is to be extracted. 
3) In a strict sense not all information in the protocol h
eader is considered IRI. Comp
ared to 2) more processing 
power will be needed and required equipment will be more complicated. The management of what items are 
IRI and what is not gives an extra complication. 
4) Compared to 2) the part law enforcement is not entitled to is not removed, but blanked. This gives the same 
load to the capacity of the delivery network etc. as a full delivery of IRI and CC. 
The options show it would be desirable for IRI only delivery that the HI2 and HI3 use very similar mechanisms to allow 

"HI3-mediator" to deliver IRI.

-10)50 Annex E (informative): 
Purpose of profiles 
E.0 Background The use of profiles is introduced at length in ISO/IEC TR 10000-1 [31]. These notes offer an explanation of the utility 
of profiles, and are inspired by a Library of Congress document Z39.50 profiles [i.2]. 
E.1 Formal definitions 
The formal definitions used in ISO/IEC TR 10000-1 [31] are quoted below: 
Profile:
 A set of one or more base standards and/or International Standardized Profiles, and, where applicable, the 
identification of chosen classes, conforming subsets, options and parameters of those base standards, or International 
Standardized Profiles necessary to accomplish a particular function. 
International Sta
ndardized Profile: An internationally agreed-to, harmonised document which describes one or more 
profiles. 

Interoperability: 
The ability of two or more IT systems to exchange information and to make mutual use of the 
information that has been exchanged. 
E.2 Purpose of profiles 
Again selectively quoting from ISO/IEC TR 10000-1 [31], the purposes of profiles are: 
• "identifying the standards and ISPs, together with appropriate classes, conforming subsets, options and 
parameters, which are necessary to accomplish identified 
functions (e.g. interoperability) or to support a class 
of applications (e.g. Transact
ion Processing applications)"; 
• "providing a means to enhance the availability for procurement of consistent implementations of functionally 

defined groups of standards and ISPs, which are expected to be the major components of real IT systems, and 
which realize the intentions of the corresponding reference models or frameworks with which the standards are 
associated". 
In other words a profile may: 
• offer some specific operational function, such as the handover of datagrams generated by a 2 Mbit/s to 

10 Mbit/s access; 
• allow any arbitrary Mediation Device (MD) and LEMF to communicate with a minimum of further 

configuration; 
• reference several standards and choices within these, to allow the above to be achieved. 
So a profile will specify: 
• some application, or some group of applications; 
• selections from a base standard, such as ETSI TS 101 671 [4], in terms of choices to be made and values to be 

assigned to parameters; 
• other supporting standards to be used, such as IETF RFC 793 [16], and their (layered) relationship to one 

another; 
• the choices to be made and values to be assigned to parameters in these supporting standards. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)51 The advantages of the use of a (carefully designed) profile then become: 
• confidence that the base standard will support the nomi
nated application(s) addressed by a specific profile; 
• confidence in procuring conformant equipment, both MD and LEMF; 
• confidence in interworking between conformant equipment; 
• reduced effort in procuring equipment; 
• reduced effort in preparing test specifications; 
• release of effort from law enforcement, manufacturers and operators for other tasks; 
• simplicity.

-10)52 Annex F (informative): 
Traffic management of the handover interface 
F.0 Rationale 
ETSI TS 101 331 [1], Requirements of Law Enforcement Agencies, sets goals for the delivery of the results of lawful 
interception. It requires that delivery be: with reliability
; with accuracy; at low cost; with minimum disruption; most 
speedily; in a secure manner; and using standard procedures. 
This annex addresses the issues that are relevant to deliv
ery in packet-switched environments and discusses traffic 
management techniques that can be used to achieve these goals. 
F.1 Factors to consider 
F.1.0 Background 
Traffic management mechanisms provide the means for achieving these goals. The objectives of traffic management are 
somewhat different in delivery of lawful intercept than they 
would be for the original intercepted traffic. In the case of 
multimedia traffic such as VoIP, the real-time constraints of 
an interactive conversation require provisions to prevent 
jitter, and to keep latency below 200 milliseconds. For the in
tercepted data these constraints do not apply as rigorously. 
Reliable delivery becomes more important and timing requirements move from real-time to near-real-time. 
The following factors need to be
 considered when devising a traffic management strategy. 
F.1.1 Burstiness 
The bursty nature of IP traffic means that the average bandwidth required for delivery of traffic on the handover 
interface between the Mediation Function (MF) and the Law Enforcement Monitoring facility (LEMF) would be a 

small fraction of the peak bandwidth of the traffic that arrives at the MF from the network equipment. Ratios of one or 
two orders of magnitude are common. The traffic will have to be managed so as to achieve economy of resource usage 
as well as timeliness of delivery. Queuing of traffic in buffers is an important tool for reducing the burstiness of IP 

traffic. 
F.1.2 Mixed content 
IP traffic contains a mix of traffic with different timeliness 
aspects. Web browsing, email, file transfers, etc. reflect 

relatively static information where delivery can be relaxed somewhat from real-time. For more dynamic 

communications such as voice over IP (VoIP) and instant messaging (both audio and video) near-real-time can be 

important for some targets, but less important for others, depending on whether a tactical or strategic situation is 

involved. 
The static and dynamic traffic categories also differ in band
width characteristics, with the static data typically being 
bursty and the VoIP-type traffic having fairly constant bandwidth. 
Some information, such as web pages or video broadcasts, may be regarded as "public" and some, such as email or 
VoIP calls, as "individual". 
If these different types of traffic can be separated, then their different characteristics can be used to advantage in making 
efficient use of the delivery channel. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)53 F.1.3 Network facilities for traffic management 
Delivery networks may have different classes of service th
at can be provisioned to accommodate delivery requirements. 
In the case of public networks with strict control (see clause 7.1.3), ATM and MPLS services may be available over 
VPNs to accommodate different requirements for timeliness and bandwidth. Public networks with loose control (see 

clause 7.1.4) such as the Internet can be used for delivery in many cases, particularly if a more reliable delivery channel 

can be made available to handle critical traffic, leaving le
ss critical traffic subject to the possible congestion problems 
that can affect Internet traffic. 
NOTE: The Internet itself is very reliable, but the Internet access part may be congested at times; hence, if both 
sides of the connection have high quality Internet access, the use of the Internet for handover is very 

reliable. 
F.1.4 Evidentiary considerations 
Collection of complete records of communication may be important, particularly if decryption of original content or 

reconstruction of binary files is necessary. In such situat
ions packet loss cannot be tolerated, and use of transport 
protocols such as UDP should be avoided, even for VoIP-type 
traffic, particularly if traffic has to pass through switches 
or routers that may drop packets when congestion is encountered. 
F.1.5 National considerations 
There may be constraints in legislation, regulations or industry practices that limit the use of some traffic management 

techniques. 
F.2 Traffic management strategies 
Some of the traffic management strategies applicable to
 the Handover Interface are described below. The traffic 
management problem is related to the availability of network resources to the Delivery Function. Solutions can be 

implemented in the Delivery Function or in the delivery network, depending on the particular circumstances 

encountered: 
• If sufficient capacity (bandwidth) is available at 
acceptable cost between the MF and LEMF to accommodate 
the traffic in a timely manner without creating congestion, then TCP alone ("best effort") will be able to 
control delivery. Bandwidth has to be adequate to avoid congestion in the delivery network that will trigger 
TCP throttling that in turn will reduce link utilization because of packet loss when buffered queues overflow in 

networking equipment. 
• If capacity is limited or if capacity needs to be utilized
 efficiently then preventive flow control measures, such 
as queuing traffic in buffers or dynamic allocation of
 bandwidth on demand, are required to guard against 
packet loss and to meet timeliness criteria. One should keep in mind that the timeliness required for monitoring 

traffic can be more relaxed than that require
d between the communicating parties themselves. 
• If traffic with mixed content is sent over a single link, then the rule of thumb in order to avoid congestion is to 

keep link utilization below 35 %. This may be readily 
achievable in circumstances where service providers 
have considerable excess capacity in the networks used 
for delivery and cost of the unused capacity is not an 
issue. This method makes planning and management relatively easy, but cost may be an issue. 
• If the mixed content can be separated, then VoIP-type traffic, which has a constant, predictable bandwidth, can 
be sent over a link that can be provisioned with higher utilization for near-real-time delivery. (If multiple 
streams are sent concurrently then the bandwidth has to be provisioned to accommodate the estimated 

maximum number of active concurrent calls with utilization kept below 40 %, as a rule of thumb.) Public 

networks with strict control, such as ATM and MPLS based networks, can provide this type of service. The 

static traffic (web, email, etc.) can be queued for delivery over a provisioned link or over public networks with 
loose control, such as the Internet. Bandwidth for this 
link can be traded off against acceptable queuing delay. 
The closer the transmission bandwidth is kept to the link capacity, the larger will be the buffering capacity 

required to queue the bursty traffic. Controlling the tran
smission is a preventive flow control measure to avoid 
packet loss that results in TCP retransmissions so as to maintain efficient link utilization. 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)54 • If the Internet is used as the delivery link, then it 
may not be possible to avoid congestion because the access to 
this link may be shared with other traffic (see note in clause F.1.3). In this case buffering on magnetic media 
such as a hard drive may be required to cope with periods of network congestion. 
NOTE: It may be possible for Communications Service Prov
iders (CSPs) to use dedicat
ed links to the nearest 
Internet Exchange node, where there is a private peering connection with the authorities. This results in a 

sort of "Virtual Private Internet". 
F.3 Bandwidth estimation 
Web data traffic may be characterized as "bursty". This char
acteristic is present even when traffic from several sources 
is aggregated. The bandwidth of bursts can be one or two orders of magnitude greater than average bandwidth 

utilization. For example, on a 3 Mbit/s DSL service, the average bandwidth use is 30 Kbit/s. Voice traffic, on the other 

hand, is fairly constant in its use of bandwidth, consuming about 150 Kbit/s for a full duplex call, although this level 

can be reduced through various compression schemes. 
While bandwidth estimation for bursty IP traffic is not an exact science and there is considerable discussion in the 
literature over estimation methodology, the following approach 
will allow us to adapt to 
a given intercept scenario. 
Assume that, for the number of targets that are being aggregated on the delivery interface, no more than one target's 

traffic will burst at any given time. Then the bandwidth required for delivery of data intercepts can be approximated by 

the maximum burst rate for one user plus the average bandwidth use for the remaining users. If 10 targets have been 
provisioned, each having a 3 Mbit/s DSL service, then the bandwidth requirement would be 3 Mbit/s plus 9 times 
30 Kbit/s (at a duty cycle of 1:100), resulting in a requirement for 3,27 Mbit/s. This is much less than the worst-case 

requirement of 30 Mbit/s that could be provisioned under the assumption that all targets could burst simultaneously. A 

safety factor of 2 or 3 should be applied for initial provisioning. This should then be followed up with monitoring of 

bandwidth utilization and buffering delay, and tuning of the provisioned bandwidth to achieve a satisfactory maximum 

buffering delay. If the Communications Service Provider 
(CSP) controls the bandwidth allocated to the delivery 
channel, then the CSP could be required to provide sufficie
nt bandwidth so that, for example, the buffering delay meets 
national requirements 95 % of the time. 
F.4 National considerations 
In some cases there may be constraints on the use of bufferin
g that will limit the extent to which the delivery channel 
utilization can be optimized. In others it may be possible to use techniques other than prioritization and buffering to 

achieve efficiency. Filtering is a useful technique, if not constrained by evidentiary requirements or other national or 
legal constraints. If traffic contains, for example, broadcast multimedia traffic that is from a known source (e.g. news 
broadcasts, entertainment broadcasts), then this traffic can be dropped by the Mediation Function, and not presented to 

the delivery interface. This is particularly useful in th
e circumstance where the Mediation Function can be controlled 
directly by the LEA over the HI1 interface. In this case me
ssages should be provided over the HI2 interface indicating 
the source of the traffic that has been dropped and the start and stop times of that traffic. 
F.5 Implementation considerations 
F.5.1 Volatile versus non-volatile storage 
Buffering should be done in volatile memory for security and efficiency reasons. Memory requirements will depend on 

the number of links supported by a delivery function and the bandwidth of each link. Buffering on non-volatile memory 

such as a hard drive should only be done when the physical security of the delivery device is adequate, or if the data can 
be encrypted on the hard drive in a sufficiently secure manner (e.g. the encryption keys are not also stored on the hard 
drive). 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)55 F.5.2 Maximum buffering time 
The maximum buffering time will depend on national constraint
s, but should, if possible, be sized to the average burst 
duration. Traffic should be monitored for its characteristics, as they will vary with the mix of traffic being intercepted as 
well as with the nature of current and new services that are being used. Because IP traffic is a non-deterministic process, 

the buffering time has to be specified in a probabilistic fashion, e.g. less than so many seconds 95 % of the time. 
F.5.3 Transmission order of buffered data 
The buffered data should be transmitted First-In-First-Out (FIFO) to facilitate reassembly at the LEMF. 
Clause 6.3.3 defines a cyclic buffer that is to be used by the Delivery Function. This same process should be applied 
when the buffering time is increased to accommodate traffic management. If buffering is used for network outages that 

cannot be accommodated in volatile memory, then the cyclic buffer can be implemented to use non-volatile memory in 

addition to volatile memory. 
F.5.4 Buffer overflow processing 
Buffering provides protection against loss of data due to equipment or network problems, and buffering capacity should 
be sized to provide sufficient time to rectify network problems without any loss of data. However, in the extreme case 
that buffer capacity is exceeded, the oldest data sh
ould be deleted to make room for newer data.

-10)56 Annex G (normative): 
Implementation of payload encryption 
When encryption/hashing/signing is used between CSP and LEA, implementations at both sides need to be strictly 
aligned to avoid issues with decryption and hash/signature
 verification at LEA side. This annex therefore provides 
step-by-step instructions for the handover process at th
e CSP side. At the LEA sides the steps can be reversed: 
1) The process starts with a generated Payload structure. Place the Payload structure into an EncryptedPayload 

structure and set the byteCounter to the correct value. 
2) BER encode the EncryptedPayload structure and add padding to the resulting octet string if necessary 

(depending on cipher agreed). 
3) Create a PS-PDU with the Payload choice set to EncryptionContainer. Set the encryptionType to 1 (none). Put 

the octet string as obtained in step 2 into the encryptedPayload parameter. 
4) DER encode the PS-PDU. 
5) Create the message digest of the DER encoded PS-PDU (according to clause 7.2.3). 
6) Store the length of the encoded PS-PDU (to update the bytecounter when creating the next EncryptedPayload). 
7) DER decode the PS-PDU. 
8) Encrypt the encryptedPayload octet string. 
9) Set the encryptionType to the appropriate value. 
10) DER encode the PS-PDU again. It can now be handled as a normal PS-PDU. 
11) Use the digest as obtained in step 5 to creat
e the TRIPayload (according to clause 7.2.3). 
NOTE 1: DER encoding is used to avoid issues with digest verification at the LEA side, as BER encoding might 
result in different encodings depending on compiler settings. 
NOTE 2: For performance reasons, implementation of steps 7 to 10 can be performed by "walking" the TLVs 
inside the DER encoded PS-PDU and replacing them. 
NOTE 3: When performing Inter LEMF handover as described in ETSI TS 103 462 [45] the role of the CSP is 
performed by the resLEMF. 
The EncryptionContainer contains an encryptedPayloadType wh
ich can be used to signal the SSD that is contained in 
the Payload structure. The appropriate value for the encrypte
dPayloadType should be set to the SSD that functionally 
describes the transmitted IRI, CC or TRI payload. This allows a LEMF endpoint to quickly route the traffic without 

decrypting it first. Some of the allowed encryption types use an Initialization Vector. The Initialization Vector need to 

be computed for each PDU by concatenating the 32 bit unsigned integer representation of the sequenceNumber from the 

PSHeader structure a number of times, as specified below: 
• aES-192-CBC: 128 bits IV by concatenating the sequenceNumber 4 times; 
• aES-256-CBC: 128 bits IV by concatenating the sequenceNumber 4 times; 
• blowfish-192-CBC: 64 bits IV by concatenating the sequenceNumber 2 times; 
• blowfish-256-CBC: 64 bits IV by concatenating the sequenceNumber 2 times; 
• threedes-cbc: 64 bits IV by concatenating the sequenceNumber 2 times. 
If padding is needed, it shall be all zeros.

national agreement. Generation and distribution of the DSA key is out of scope of the present document. 
Chain: 
integrity checks run within the context of a communicationIdentifier. This means there are separate integrity 
check "chains" for each combination of LIID, communicationIdentifier (communications session) and dataType (IRI, 
CC or iLHI). Each Chain has its own sequenceNumber counter. 
NOTE 1: In normal circumstances this results in 4 (four) Chains/sequenceNumber counters per 
communicationIdentifier: CC/hashes, IRI/hashes, CC/signatures, IRI/signatures).  
NOTE 2: For Inter LEMF handover as defined in ETSI TS 103 462 [45] this results in 2 (two) 
Chains/sequenceNumber counters per communicationIdentifier: iLHI/hashes, iLHI/signatures. 
hashTimeout:
 number of seconds after which a hash shall be generated. Value is up to national agreement, typical 
value is 1 second. 
signTimeout:
 number of seconds after which a signature shall be generated. Value is up to national agreement, typical 
value is 300 seconds. 
dataPduCount:
 number of DataPDUs after which a hash shall be generated. Value is up to national agreement, typical 
value is 1 000.  

hashPduCount:
 number of Hashes after which a signature shall be generated. Value is up to national agreement, 
typical value is 15. 
J.2 Process description 
Within each Chain, a Hash is generated over the previously sent DataPDUs and sent: 
• when <hashTimeout> is reached (timer starts when the firs
t DataPDU is to be included in the hash and is reset 
after <hashTimeout> is reached); or 
• when <dataPduCount> of DataPDUs are sent; or 
• when the intercept on the target is term
inated and there are unhashed DataPDUs. 
The includedSequenceNumbers sequence shall contain the sequence numbers of the DataPDUs over which the hash is 
computed, in the order they were included in the hash calculation. 
NOTE: The hashTimeout timer is only started after a DataPDU is being included in the next Hash, this prevents 
an endless Chain for each communications session of the target. If there is no more handover for this 

session, the Chain will end. 
Within each Chain, a signature is generated and sent over the previously sent Hashes: 
• when <signTimeout> is reached (timer starts when the fi
rst Hash is to be included in the signature and reset 

after <signTimeout> is reached); or 
  ETSI ETSI TS 102 232
-1 V3.18.1 (2018
-10)66 • when <hashPduCount> of hashes are sent; or 
• when the intercept on the target is terminated and there are unsigned Hashes.  
The includedSequenceNumbers sequence shall contain the sequence numbers of the IntegrityCheck PDUs over which 
the signature is computed, in the order they were sent.
