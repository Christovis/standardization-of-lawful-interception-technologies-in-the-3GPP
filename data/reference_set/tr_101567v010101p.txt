  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 7 1 Scope The present document provides an overview of Cloud/virtual services and studies. This includes Lawful Interception 
(LI) and Retained Data (RD) aspects of these services 
in the converged Cloud/virtual service environment, the 
challenges and obstacles of complying with those obligati
ons, what implementations can be achieved under existing 
ETSI LI standards and what new work may be required to achieve needed Lawful Interception capabilities. 
Cloud Services, in whichever forms they take (Infrastructure, Software, Platform or combinations of these), are often 
trans-border in nature and the information required to maintain LI and RD capability or sufficient coverage for LI/RD 
support may vary in different countries or within platforms of different security assurance levels. The present document 
aims to ensure capabilities can be maintained while allowing business to utilize the advantages and innovations of 

Cloud Services and was undertaken cooperatively with relevant Cloud security technical bodies.

verifying the identity of a user, process or device,
 often as a prerequisite to allowing access to 
resources in an information system
 broad network access:
 capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that 
promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, laptops and workstations) 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (20
16-01) 9 Cloud communication centre:
 service that enables advanced features for 
the customer-enterprise interaction using the 
communication and management capabilities provided by a Cloud based telecommunication infrastructure (managed by 
the Cloud service provider) 
Cloud computing: 
model for enabling service user's ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared 
pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction 
NOTE: Cloud computing enables Cloud services. 
Cloud federation: 
manner to implement inter-Cloud computing in which mutually trusted clouds logically join 
together by integrating their resources 
NOTE: Cloud federation allows a Cloud service provider to dynamically outsource resources to other Cloud 
service provider in response to demand variations. 
Cloud infrastructure:
 basis of a Cloud, which provides capabilities for computing, storage and network resources, 
including resource orchestration, virtualization and sharing 
NOTE: It also provides relevant cross layer supporting functions to support the upper layer Cloud services as 
well. 
Cloud Lawful Interception Function (CLIF):
 architecture or system in a Cloud virtualization environment that 
provides for the instantiation of LI capabilities including receiving and responding to structured expressions for LEA 
Lawful Interception production requests 
Cloud platform:
 set of capabilities to develop and enable Cloud Services utilizing information technology and 
communication resources. Some combinations of platform 
functionalities can be provided as Cloud services 
Cloud service:
 service that is delivered and consumed on demand at any time, through any access network and using 
any connected devices using Cloud computing technologies 

Cloud service partner (CSN):
 person or organization who provides support to Cloud service provider's service offer 
building (e.g. service integration)  

CLoud Service Provider (C(L)SP):
 provider that provides and/or maintains Cloud services 
Cloud Service User (CSU):
 person or organization that consumes Cloud services 
NOTE: End-users can be persons, machines, applications. 
Communications as a Service (CaaS):
 category of Cloud services where the capability provided to the Cloud service 
user is to use real time communication and collaboration services (this includes voice over IP, instant messaging, video 
conferencing, for different user devices) 
community Cloud:
 Cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from 
organizations that have shared concerns (e.g. mission, 
security requirements, policy and compliance considerations)

party or some combination of them and it may exist on or off premises. 
compliance:
 act of adhering to and demonstrating 
adherence to, a standard or regulation 
control: ability to decide, with high confidence, who and what is allowed to access subscriber data and programs and 
the ability to perform actions 

Data as a Service (DaaS):
 category of Cloud services where a service provides access to data on user demand 
regardless of geographic or organizational separation of provider and consumer 
NOTE: DaaS includes the capability of presenting the data in the form and structure required by the consumer 
rather than requiring extensive knowledge of the underlying physical data form and structure.  
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 10 hybrid Cloud:
 Cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain 
unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application 
portability (e.g. Cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds) 
NOTE: It should be noted that the Cloud deployment models do not reflect where services, platforms, 
applications, resources are actually hosted. For example,
 a private Cloud can be hosted internally (on-site) 
or externally (outsourced). 
hypervisor:
 virtualization component that manages the guest OSs on a host and controls the flow of instructions 
between the guest OSs and the physical hardware 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): 
computing resources (generally hardware) provided by the Cloud service provider 
to allow the consumer to run consumer provided software including operating systems 
NOTE: The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks and other 
fundamental computing resources where the consumer is
 able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which 
can include operating systems and applications. The co
nsumer does not manage or control the underlying 
Cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage and deployed applications; and 
possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g. host firewalls). 
instantiation:
 creation of a real instance or particular realization of
 an abstraction or template such as a class of objects 
or a computer process 
NOTE: To instantiate is to create such an instance by, fo
r example, defining one particular variation of object 
within a class, giving it a name and locating it in some physical place. 
inter-Cloud computing:
 on-demand reassignment of Cloud resources including compute, storage and network and 
transfer of workload through interworking of Cloud systems 
inter-Cloud federation: manner to implement inter-Cloud computing in which mutually trusted clouds logically join 
together by integrating their resources 
NOTE: Inter-Cloud federation allows a C(L)SP to dynamically outsource resources to other C(L)SPs in response 
to demand variations. 
inter-Cloud peering: direct inter-connection between two C(L)SPs 
Inter-Cloud Service Broker (ISB):
 indirect interconnection between two (or more) C(L)SPs achieved through an 
interconnecting C(L)SP which, in addition to providing interworking service functions between the interconnected 
C(L)SPs, also provides brokering service functions for one (or more) of the interconnected C(L)SPs 
NOTE 1: ISB also covers the case in which one (or more) 
of the interconnected entities receiving brokering service 
is a Cloud service user (CSU).  
NOTE 2: Brokering service functions generally include, but are not limited to, the following three categories: 
service intermediation, service aggregation and service arbitrage. 
measured service:
 Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability 
at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g. storage, processing, bandwidth and active user 

accounts) 
NOTE: Resource usage can be monitored, controlled and reported, providing transparency for both the Cloud 
service provider and Cloud service user of the utilized service. 
multi-tenancy:
 characteristic of Cloud in which resources are shared amongst multiple Cloud tenants 
Network Function (NF):
 functional building block within a network infrastructure, which has well-defined external 
interfaces and a well-defined functional behaviour 
NOTE: In practical terms, a Network Function is today often a network node or physical appliance. 
NFV Infrastructure (NFVI):
 totality of all hardware and software components which build up the environment in 
which VNFs are deployed 
NOTE 1: The NFV-Infrastructure can span across several locations, i.e. multiple N-PoPs. The network providing 
connectivity between these locations is regard
ed to be part of the NFV-Infrastructure. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 11 NOTE 2: N-PoP is defined as Network Point of Presence. 
Network as a Service (NaaS):
 category of Cloud services where the capabilit
y provided to the Cloud service user is to 
use transport connectivity services and/or inter-Cloud network connectivity services 
NOTE: NaaS services include flexible and extended VPN, Bandwidth on demand, etc. 
on-demand self-service:
 Cloud service user can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time, 
network storage and communication and collaboration servi
ces, as needed automatically without requiring human 
interaction with each service's Cloud service provider 
orchestration:
 orchestration refers to combining multiple automation tasks to provision the network, storage array, 
storage area network, firewalls, hypervisor, operating system and even the application 

partitioning:
 managing guest operating system access to hardware so that each guest OS can access its own resources 
but cannot encroach on the other guest OSs' resources 
or any resources not allocated for virtualization use 
Platform as a Service (PaaS):
 hardware and software resources and tools allowing consumer to deploy consumer 
created or acquired applications using programming languages, libraries, services and tool provided by the Cloud 
service provider 
NOTE: The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the Cloud infrastructure consumer-created or 
acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services and tools supported by the 

provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying Cloud infrastructure including 
network, servers, operating systems or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and 
possibly the application-hosting environment. 
private Cloud:
 Cloud infrastructure is operated solely for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple 
consumers (e.g. business units) 
NOTE: It may be owned, managed or operated by the organization, a third party or some combination of them. 
public Cloud:
 Cloud infrastructure provisioned for open use by the general public 
NOTE: It may be owned, managed or operated by a business, academic or government organization or some 
combination of them. 
resource:
 any kinds of resources to be shared to compose Cloud 
services including computing power, storage, network, 
database and applications 
service:
 component of the portfolio of choices offered by service providers to a user, a functionality offered to a user, as 
defined in ETSI TR 121 905 [i.15] 
NOTE: A user may be an end-customer, a network or some intermediate entity.  
service aggregation:
 combines and integrates multiple services into one or more new services 
NOTE: It ensures that data are modelled across all com
ponent services and integrated, as well as ensures the 
movement and security of data between the Cloud service user and multiple Cloud service providers. 
service arbitrage:
 similar to the service aggregation capability 
NOTE: The difference between them is that the services being aggregated are not fixed. Indeed, the goal of 
arbitrage is to provide flexibility and opportunistic choices for the service aggregator, e.g. providing 
multiple e-mail services through one Cloud service provider or providing a credit-scoring service that 

checks multiple scoring agencies and selects the best score. 
Service Delivery Platform:
 system architecture or environment that 
enables the efficient creation, deployment, 
execution orchestration and management of one or more classes of services 
service intermediation:
 service that directly enhances a given service 
delivered to one or more Cloud service users, 
essentially adding value on top of a given service to enhance some specific capability 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 12 Software as a Service (SaaS):
 allows the consumer to use Cloud service provider's applications 
NOTE: The applications are shared, but the consumer 
may have private application specific data such as 
application configuration settings. The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's 
applications running on a Cloud infrastructure. The a
pplications are accessible from various client devices 
through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g. web-based email) or a program 

interface. The consumer does not manage or contro
l the underlying Cloud infrastructure including 
network, servers, operating systems, storage or even individual application capabilities, with the possible 

exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings. 
user service:
 component of the portfolio of choices offered by service providers to the end-users/customers/subscriber 
Virtual Data Centre (VDC):
 evolutionary computing model that presents the data centre as a service view to a single 
computer, which virtualizes all hardware and software resources behind it 
Virtual Desktop as a Service (VDaaS):
 capability provided to the Cloud service user to use virtualized desktops from 
a Cloud service provider in the form of outsourcing 
NOTE: VDaaS is also called virtual desktop or hosted desktop services, is the outsourcing of virtual desktop 
infrastructure (VDI). The consumer's personal data is copied to and from the virtual desktop during 
login/logoff and access to the desktop is device, location and network independent. The virtual desktop 

can be delivered either through a client-server model or through a web interface. 
virtual hardware:
 hardware (including the CPU, controllers, Ethern
et devices and disks) that is seen by the guest 
software 
virtual machine:
 complete environment that supports the execution of guest software 
NOTE 1:  A virtual machine is a full encapsulation of the virtual hardware, virtual disks and the metadata 
associated with it 
NOTE 2: Virtual machines allow multiplexing of the under
lying physical machine through a software layer called a 
hypervisor. 
Virtualized Network Function (VNF):
 implementation of an NF that can be deployed on a Network Function 
Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) 

virtualization: 
simulation of the software and/or hardware upon which other software runs

4 Cloud Services Overview 
4.1 Introduction 
Cloud services are very diverse and constantly evolving. Work is on-going in many different industry standards forums 
listed in annex B on service conceptualization, reference architectures, infrastructure models and resource management. 

Many of the service definitions that have achieved a level of stability are included in clause 3. This clause provides an 

overview on Cloud/virtual services. 
Figure 4-1 provides a model of the Cloud ecosystem that depicts the relationships amongst the three major players in 
the present document: users/subscribers, the Cloud service providers and traditional/communication service providers 
with whom the users/subscribers may have a commercial relationship. Cloud service providers and communication 
service providers may also have a commercial relationship independent of those with the users/subscribers. 
 Figure 4-1: Cloud Ecosystem 
4.2 Perspectives on Cloud services 
4.2.1 Introduction 
Cloud computing, including distributed virtual services, is an evolving paradigm that is fundamentally and rapid 

changing communication services and infrastructure. 
The diversity of these services and the underlying infrastructure has itself produced different perspectives. 
       Enterprises
 User  Cloud Providers (SaaS, PaaS
) Service Providers    ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 17 In general, most of the many forums dealing with Cloud computing have found common ground in the following 
description (Special Publication 800-145, The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, Sept 2011 [i.9]): 
"Cloud Computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly 

provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This Cloud model promotes 

availability and is composed of five essential characterist
ics, three service models and four deployment models." 
4.2.2 General characteristics of Cloud services 
On-demand self-service: 
A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and 
network storage, as needed automatically without re
quiring human interaction with each service provider. 
Broad network access: 
Capabilities are available over the network an
d accessed through standard mechanisms that 
promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, laptops and workstations). 

Resource pooling: 
The provider's computing resources are pooled to
 serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant 
model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer 
demand. Cloud services are location independent. The custom
er generally has no control or knowledge over the exact 
location of the provided resources but may be able to specify 
location at a higher level of ab
straction (e.g. country, state 
or data centre). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth and virtual machines. 
Rapid elasticity: 
Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and releas
ed, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly 
outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often 
appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time. 
Measured service: 
Cloud systems control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level 
of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g. stor
age, processing, bandwidth and active user accounts). Resource 
usage can be monitored, controlled and reported, providi
ng transparency for both the provider and consumer of the 
utilized service. 
4.2.3 Service models for Cloud services 
Cloud computing enables hardware and software to be delivered as "services" that are provided on demand or sold on a 
usage basis. The following are common service models, which are defined in detail in clause 3.1: 
• Communications as a Service (CaaS) 
• Data as a Service (DaaS) 
• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
• Network as a Service (NaaS) 
• Platform as a Service (Paas) 
• Software as a Service (Saas) 
• Virtual Desktop as a Service (VDaaS) 
4.2.4 Deployment models for Cloud services 
Private Cloud: 
The Cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple 
consumers (e.g. business units). It may be owned, managed and operated by the organization, a third party or some 

combination of them and it may exist on or off premises. 
Community Cloud: 
The Cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers 
from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g. 
mission, security requirements, policy and compliance 
considerations). It may be owned, managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third 

party or some combination of them and it may exist on or off premises. 
Public Cloud: 
The Cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed 
and operated by a business, academic or government organization or some combination of them. It exists on the 
premises of the Cloud provider. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 18 Hybrid Cloud: 
The Cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct Cloud infrastructures (private, 
community or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that 
enables data and application portability (e.g. Cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds). 
4.3 Cloud reference architectures and infrastructures 
The Cloud architecture meets several needs to enable sustained innovation and development of Cloud services. With 

multiple stakeholders involved, the Cloud architecture be flexible to fit the needs of infrastructure C(L)SPs, CSPs and 

service resellers. The following high-level needs ar
e broadly envisioned for the Cloud architecture: 
• Support for many standards within the same Cloud infrastructure and allow for evolution of these standards, 
without requiring disruptive infrastructure changes. 
• Broadband access. 
• The Cloud architecture enables multiple current and future deployment models, Cloud service categories and 
use cases, in whole or in part. 
• For private and hybrid Cloud operations, Cloud services need to appear like intranet services. 
• Early detection, diagnosis and fixing of infrastructure or service-related problems. 
• Auditing and compliance, including service-level 
monitoring of resources allocated to users. 
• Invisibility of Cloud resource allocations to Cloud service users. A C(L)SP may choose to expose service-

operation details without having to share Cloud internal infrastructure allocation and provisioning details for 

security and business reasons, including meeting LI needs. 
• Users consuming Cloud services are able to control Cl
oud resource access to the CSP transparently and enable 
IT procedures to work without compromise in legal or organizational mandates.  
• Intranet-level security capabilities that may includ
e access records, activity reports, session monitoring, 

firewalling, access control and malicious attack detection and prevention. 
• Resource mobility which includes virtual machine mobility. 
• Resource scalability. 
• Naming identity management. 
• Automated resource deployments. 
Cloud computing reference architectures typically make use of a framework that defines the layers of a Cloud 

functional architecture derived by grouping Cloud related functions, see Figure 4-2. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 19  Source: ITU-T Focus Group on Cloud Computing Technical Report, Part 2: Functional requirements and reference 
architecture (02/2012) [i.20]. 
 Figure 4-2: Cloud related functions 
The user layer performs interaction between the Cloud service user and the Cloud infrastructure. The user layer is used 
to set up a secure mechanism with the Cloud, to send Cloud service requests to the Cloud and receive Cloud services 
from the Cloud, perform Cloud service access and administrate and monitor Cloud resources. 
The access layer provides a common interface for both manual and automated Cloud service capabilities and service 
consumption. The access layer accepts Cloud service consumption requests using Cloud APIs to access services and 

resources. 
The services layer is where services are orchestrated and exposed in the five Cloud service categories. The resources 
and network layer is where the physical resources reside. Five categories are typical: Communication as a Service, 
Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service and Network as a Service. 
Cross-layer functions perform overall system management (i.e. operations, administration, maintenance and 
provisioning and monitoring, including secure mechanisms. 
One architecture dimension that is unique to the Cloud/virt
ual environment is the concept of the Inter-Cloud function. 
Cloud services are expected to be offered by C(L)SPs globally and rely on inter-Cloud connections with other C(L)SPs. 
The inter-Cloud function can be implemented through inter-Cloud peering, inter-Cloud service broker and inter-Cloud 
federation arrangements. 
The Cloud/virtual services reference architecture abstractions are ultimately manifested across multiple network 
infrastructures as depicted in Figure 4-3. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 20  Figure 4-3: Cloud/virtual network infrastructure model (ITU-T Cloud TR3) 
These resulting infrastructures in turn enable the far reaching changes being witnessed today. Millions of "app" clients 
can autonomously provide to many different mobile and fixed end user smart devices that facilitate direct access to 

tailored services, see Figure 4-4. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 21  Figure 4-4: Cloud/virtual infrastructure (ITU-T Technical Report Part 2 [i.20], fig. I.1) 
4.4 Resource management 
Resource management is necessary for maintaining processing, storage and I/O capabilities - physical and virtual - 
within or across Cloud environments. Cloud infrastructure should provide a unified resource management function for 

the upper-layers (including virtualized and physical computing resource, storage resource and network resource). The 

resource management function should provide resource packaging, resource deployment and resource scheduling, 
whilst managing templates and assets. 
Resource packaging provides a unified interface of heterogeneous resource, whether virtualized or physical, to upper-
layers for management and utilization. Resource deployment and scheduling provide elastic, dynamic, on-demand and 

automation management for the down-layers, based on user
-defined policies. They also provide resource access control 
interfaces to the upper-layers and can dynamically allocate th
e resource by the real-time monitoring of applications and 
SLAs. Template management provides the capability to describe groups of computing, storage and network resources 

within their life cycles. Asset management provides unified management of the physical devices, including 

configuration information and topology of assets. 
Resource management is a critical enabler and consists of th
e ability in a trusted manner to uniquely identify, locate, 
acquire, format, protect and deliver specific forensics descri
bed by a target signature. all these may necessitate an 
overlay, compartmentalized resource management implementation. 
A Cloud resource management model in common use is depicted in Figure 4-5. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 22  Figure 4-5: Cloud resource management model (ITU-T Technical Report Part 3 [i.21], Fig 11) 
An abstract view of the resource management model is shown in Figure 4-6. 
 Figure 4-6: Resource management model (ITU-T Technical Report Part 3, Fig 13) 
One of the most important of these virtual entities is the Resource Provider. It is the entity which provides and 
maintains virtualized resources to the resource management platform and is consists of hypervisors. 
4.5 Enabling Mobile Cloud 
The Cloud ecosystem is already taking shape and a number of players from IT, as well as Over-The-Top (OTT) players 

already offer agility and scalability through their service offerings. 
The fixed and mobile telecommunications network operators have deployed an extensive infrastructure (distributed data 
centres, broadband access, application servers, etc.) that is 
ripe for virtualization, allowing these operators to better 
monetize these resources. 
The telecom operators have some important advantages, especially through their existing, strong customer relationship, 
billing expertise and customer services, which are important for companies wanting to deploy Cloud services. 
As such, the operators are in a unique position, especially the mobile operators, to offer a wide variety of bundling of 
Cloud and network services for customers that practically ma
intain and expand their business with their existing service 
provider. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 23 The Mobile Cloud enables existing and new Cloud services to be ubiquitously available across multiple, separate 
mobile network operator domains. 
The Mobile Cloud Providers (MCPs) are the "intermediaries" facilitating the implementation of a Mobile Cloud through 
agreements with individual network operators (based upon wholesale models). 
By using a MCP the Service Providers (SPs) can have a single interface and single business relationship, but interwork 
with multiple network operators. 
From a user's service perspective, one can look at the Cloud environment as an on-demand environment where various 
services controlled by other organizations can be leveraged and 
composed for the use of a user, so that the services that 
are outside of an organization's own boundaries, operated and controlled by other organizations can become part of the 

aggregated portfolio of services of that organization (e.g. 
file storage and backup). A Mobile Cloud's example relevant 

to 3GPP is GSMA's OneAPI's objective is to provide a cross-operator domains framework for Mobile Cloud 
Computing. Based upon OneAPI, the GSMA is acting as a 
Mobile Cloud Provider/Aggregator, providing SPs access to 
network resources and charging capabilities (NaaS type of Cloud) of multiple mobile operators.

5.1 Introduction 
Virtualized Services, in the present document, refer to the work being studied by ETSI's Network Functions 
Virtualization Industry Specification Group (NFV ISG). Network Functions Virtualization aims to address operator 
problems of increasingly complex and proprietary hardware by leveraging standard IT virtualization technology to 
consolidate many network equipment types onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage, which 

could be located in Datacentres, Network Nodes and in th
e end user premises. NFV ISG documents can be found at 
ETSI GS NFV 002 [i.13] and ETSI GS NFV 003 [i.14]. 
The goal of NFV is to use virtualization to separate network function hardware software. This allows the consolidation 
of many network equipment types onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage. Since Virtualized 
Network Functions (VNFs) are implemented in software, network operations change as the software can be 

dynamically moved to or instantiated in, various locations in the network as required, without the need for installation 

of new equipment. VNF's connection to Cloud computing is that VNFs and the VNF Infrastructure can use Cloud 

computing's agility and resource sharing. 
Traditional network nodes can be considered as a different Network Functions (NFs), which may be virtualized by the 
CSP. There may be some impacts to LI: 
• LI functions may not be taken into consideration. 
• LI security may not be taken into consideration, NIST SP 800-144 [i.10]. 
• Others TBD. 
For the purposes of the present document, NFV is virtualizing the network operator's internal functions transparently to 
their subscribers. Likewise, NFV is complementary to another industry endeavour referred to as Software Defined 
Networking (SDN), in which control of a function is decoupled from hardware and given to a software application 
called a controller. 
For example, SDN allows network engineers and administrators to monitor and quickly respond to changes in network 
needs without having to physically touch individual switches. Th
ey are able to modify switch rules, such as in traffic 
prioritization or block specific types of pack
ets with a very precise level of control. 
The introduction of NFV results in faster deployments of new network services and greater flexibility to dynamically 

scale the VNF performance and needed capacity. 
Figure 5-1 (from ETSI GS NFV 002 [i.13]), depicts the NFV reference architecture framework. Network functions are 
software-only entities running on the NFV Infrastructure (NFVI). The NFVI includes diverse physical resources that 

can be virtualized and supports the execution of the VNFs. The NFV Management and Orchestration handles all the 

virtualization-specific management tasks necessary and the or
chestration and lifecycle management of physical and/or 
software resources that support the infrastructure virtualization. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 25  Figure 5-1: NFV reference architectural framework 
The decoupling of hardware and software in the network functions is realized by a virtualization layer. This layer 
abstracts hardware resources of the NFVI. ETSI GS NFV 001 [i.17] includes uses cases and examples of target NFs for 

virtualization. Some examples of NFs are: 
• 3GPP Evolved Packet Core network elements (e.g. Mobility Management Entity MME), Serving Gateway 

(SGW), Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW)). 
• Residential Gateway (RGW) in a home network. 
• Conventional network functions such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers, firewalls, etc. 
5.2 NFV relationship to Cloud Services 
There are instances in existing networks where network operators have pooled resources (e.g. MSC Pooling); 

virtualization and Cloud services use the concept of resource pooling as well. Network virtualization allows new 

business opportunities similar to Cloud service models. A CSP could offer so or all of its NFV Infrastructure as a 

service to other CSPs. For example, a VNF owner may not 
necessarily "own" the NFV infrastructure needed for the 
functioning and operation of the VNF. Since VNFs can be provid
ed by different Service Providers, they may enable an 
efficient service to global customers. 
5.3 NFV standardization 
The telecommunications industry uses traditional standardization procedures to develop specifications on which 
prototyping and testing efforts are based. The information technology industry embraces an "open source" model where 
a community of developers contribute an
d integrate pieces of software under terms that facilitate open collaboration and 
usage. The process of building elements based on these open 
pieces is driven according to short code-build-test cycles 
of software prototypes and less stringent agreement rules, based on what has been termed "rough consensus". 
In one of their white papers ETSI NFV ISG [i.16], the NF
V ISG has stated a preference in using the open source model 
to progress NFV implementation quickly without being delayed by standardization with the expectation that SDOs will 
either update existing specifications or quickly create new specifications to ensure interoperability.

6.1 Introduction 
The on-going work in the industry and standards forums dealing with Cloud and virtual services recognize that a broad 
array of existing legal obligations apply to the services being provided, including lawful interception. This clause 
describes lawful interception obligations. 
6.2 LEA 6.2.1 Identify and communicate with 
the responsible service providers 
The most fundamental need for LEAs is to be able to iden
tify and communicate with the service provider(s) responsible 
for the communications involving specific targets. Cloud environments are especially chal
lenging because the relevant 
C(L)SP providers are often not subject to registration, regulatory or CSP partnership needs that facilitate discovery of 
their identity(ies). Furthermore, the responsible providers' 
relationships are often complex. For example, relationships 
are layered, where an application service provider with th
e direct customer relationship uses a Software-as-a-Service 
provider that aggregates Infrastructure-as-a-Service resources at a data centre. 
6.2.2 Facilitate access and deliver
y across different jurisdictions 
While the legal and regulatory aspects of multi and cross jurisdictional handovers is out of scope of the present 

document, the implementation of common structured expressions for the eWarrant and handover information can 
provide the technical underpinnings for facilitating such implementations. 
Due to the nomadic access to Cloud services, no one provider 
(as described in Figure 5-1) is likely to be capable of 
dealing with all warrants/intercept requests. Because LI oblig
ations are largely oriented around national jurisdiction and 
geography, it is unlikely that LEAs can serve a warrant on a Cloud provider directly unless that Cloud provider has an 

"in country" presence. 
The specific Cloud resources are generally not important nor should their geographical location - as long as they are 
within the jurisdiction of the LEA. The following list identifies when a CSP/C(L)SP is able to intercept the traffic on the 
(local) LEA's behalf: 
• The warrant complies with the laws of that country. 
• The traffic is present (i.e. it needs to be routed or hand
led in the same country). Duplication is permitted as is 
rerouting as long as the user or any other unauthorised party remains unaware of LEA interest. 
• It is possible to clearly distinguish this traffic from others (i.e. no collateral interception). 
• If the traffic is encrypted, the entity responsible for key management ensures it can be decrypted by the 

CSP/C(L)SP or LEA. 
6.2.3 Existing telecommunication
s services implemented using 
Cloud/virtual capabilities 
Substantial diversity exists among Cloud facilities and services that affect the nature and implementation of Law 

Enforcement Agency (LEA) needs. However, if a CSP el
ects to implement a Cloud service and becomes a C(L)SP, 

their legal obligation to support LI is unchanged. To the extent relevant, the needs of Law Enforcement Agencies 

articulated in ETSI TS 101 331 [i.1] still apply. What may be impacted are the technical solutions outlined in ETSI LI 

standards as the underlying architecture may be changed by the implementation of Cloud services. 
The specific Cloud service that is to be intercepted is subject to national laws. National laws may require different 
levels of capabilities and procedures for LI in public and private networks. Additionally, the definitions of a private 

network may vary with jurisdictions. 
The list below provides examples of the telecommunications services for which there are LI solutions: 
• Voice, conferencing, IMS-based services 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 27 • Messaging (SMS, E-mail, etc.) 
• Internet Access 
Other services - most of which are Cloud-based - have no standardized LI solution. This includes services such as file 
sharing, telepresence, so-called "social networks" or "virtual games". In most countries, there are no existing regulations 

concerning these services. 
6.3 CSP / C(L)SP Provider Obligations 
6.3.1 Overview 
CSPs typically have a number of responsibilities which can be roughly summarized into two areas: 
• Provision and Maintenance of lawful interception capability. 
• Protection of information and activities pursuant to this responsibility. 
In accordance to national law, CSPs are 
still responsible to provide the "access"
 interception capability and "service" 
interception capability for those services which they offer. 
The introduction of NFV does not alter the national obligations of the CSPs/C(L)SPs. However, with the on-going NFV 
development, it is unclear how LI functionality will be realized in the NFV environment. 
C(L)SPs and Cloud facility operators are subject to many legal and regulatory obligations that vary among the 
jurisdictions in which they have physical presence or offer service. Service agreements among C(L)SPs and with CSPs 
may also impose additional obligations. 
National regulations may determine if and which type of Cloud providers (e.g. CaaS, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) will be subject 
to lawful interception obligations. National regulations may determine other means to identify which Cloud providers 

have lawful interception obligations (e.g. by specific service provided). Some Cloud providers may have an obligation 

because they offer a particular user serv
ice identified in that nation as requ
ired to be intercepted but other Cloud 
providers would not have a similar obligation if they do not offer services specifically identified. 
Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) may also provide support for some of those obligations by service agreement and 
local/national law. 
In most jurisdictions, CSPs or their designated TTP support law enforcement requests for lawful interception in a timely 
fashion and in a manner that complies with the law and other obligations of that jurisdiction. See clause 6.2.1. 
A generic overview of how CSP's view interception responsibilities is described below. 
 Figure 6-1: CSP LI Obligation According to Type of Service 
6.3.2 Use of trusted third parties (TTP) 
A CSP or LEA may choose to ask a TTP to help meet their obligations and needs. Based on agreements, the TTP may 
perform some functions in support of the responsibilities of the CSP and LEA. Ultimately, the responsibility to ensure 
the capabilities outlined in the present document are available, lies with the CSP or LEA. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 28 6.4 LI implementation scenarios 
Most existing LI solutions are either done per service or based on the type of access network, which is depicted in 
Figure 6-2. 
 Figure 6-2: Types of Interception 
Figure 6-2 also identifies some of the subject identities used in each type of Interception. Generically, these identifiers 

are either equipment based or service/subscriber based. In so
me existing LI solutions, LI can be accomplished on either 
known identifier, because the network or service provider is aware and maintains a binding between the two. 
The ability to implement LI capabilities varies significantly among these groups as described in Figure 6-3. Thus, the 
expectations of LEAs are inherently constrained based on
 the access location and nature of the service provider and 
request-responses tailored to the type of provider. 
Figure 6-3: Cloud LI Implementation Scenarios 
6.5 Implementation Challenges 
6.5.1 Introduction 
The introduction of Cloud services may increase the complexity and challenges for Lawful interception. The variations 
of Cloud services (e.g. IaaS, CaaS, PaaS) may introduce 
new or more complex business models and relationships 
amongst CSPs/C(L)SPs. Some specific challenges are described in more detail. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 29 6.5.2 Encryption Challenge 
Media and/or metadata may be encrypted by many parties. 
Subscribers using Cloud services will expect C(L)SPs to protect/secure their data. This includes authenticating via 
secure connections and securely transferring data to/from th
eir servers. It may also include encrypting "data at rest" 
when stored on the servers. In addition, subscribers of Clou
d services may encrypt the data prior to transferring it "into 
the Cloud". End-user encryption usage may actually increase with Cloud services as this ensures a subscriber of 

exclusive control over their data and prevents C(L)SPs from accessing their subscriber's data for their own uses (e.g. 

data mining). 
It is clear from ETSI TS 101 331 [i.1] that service providers who initiate encryption provide intercepted 
telecommunications (i.e. content and IRI) 
en clair 
(unencrypted) or if they cannot remove the encryption, provide the 
LEA with the keys and other information needed to access the 
information where such keys are available to the service 
provider. It is up to national regulations to determine how C(L)SPs need to meet the assistance obligations in ETSI 

TS 101 331 [i.1]. 
The "end-user encryption problem" exists in current (i.e. non-Cloud) networks today. Although Cloud Services may 
increase the problem for LEAs, it is not a new problem. 
From ETSI GS NFV 001 [i.17]: the virtualized environment needs to guarantee complete isolation between users. Data 
encryption of cached content and link security is mandatory. The CSP/C(L)SP that employs network virtualization 

needs to meet the assistance obligations in ETSI TS 101 331 [i.1]. 
6.5.3 Multiple copies of intercepted traffic 
The traffic may be intercepted in more than one location or on more than one CSP network. 
6.5.4 Integration of Partial Communication Segments 
The traffic intercepted from multiple communications as part of the same target session may need to be integrated. 
6.5.5 Nomadicity 
The ability for subscribers to change access technology (e.g. cellular, WiFi, DSL) and maintain continuity of some 

services exists today. If LI is at the service level, that service provider can provide the service logic, but may not have 
access to the communications content. If LI is at the acces
s level, the access provider can provide what is being 
transmitted to and from that device, but since there is no understanding of the service(s) being used at the time, the 
access provider is unable to provide any 
assistance to the LEA on how to interpre
t the data. Neither the service provider 
nor the access provider may have the ability to assist the LEA with correlating identities across their domains. One of 

the challenges to this is that the identifiers used by the service provider and access network operator will be different 
and difficult for the LEA to maintain the binding of the identifiers/addresses between the domains. 
By definition, Cloud services support a subscriber's nomadicity. The proliferation of smartphones and tablets coupled 
with a growing ubiquitous broadband network(s) are enabling 
people to stay constantly connected with an expectation 
of uninterrupted access to information.
 While subscribers own and use multiple devices for different purposes, 
smartphones with their smaller form factor are the primary devices for information and communications on the move. 
A subscriber's ability to access their data and services from any device, especially devices with no known association 
(e.g. not owned) with the intercept subject, also exists today (e.g. Internet Cafes) and complicates an LEA's ability to 
initiate an access level lawful interception in a timely ma
nner. The "any device, anywhere" characteristic of Cloud 
services just adds to the LEA's challenges. 
6.5.6 Location 
The location at which users are using Cloud based services may be difficult to discern in an assured manner. 
While this clause uses ETSI TS 101 671 [i.2] as a basis for 
this discussion, it may be additionally valid for all other LI 
specifications. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 30 ETSI TS 101 671 [i.2] defines Location information as "information relating to the geographic, physical or logical 
location of an identity relating to an interception subject." The HI2 interface 
port transports all Intercept Related 
Information (IRI), i.e. the information or data associated with the communication services of the target identity apparent 

to the network, which carries location information. From ETSI TS 101 671 [i.2] (V3.10.1): 
Location ::= SEQUENCE {  e164-Number   
[1] OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..25)) OPTIONAL,   -- Coded in the same format as the ISUP location number (parameter field)   -- of the ISUP (see EN 300 356 [5]).  globalCellID  [2] OCTET STRING (SIZE (5..7)) OPTIONAL,   -- See MAP format (see TS GSM 09.02 [32]).  tetraLocation  
[3] TetraLocation OPTIONAL,   -- This optional parameter is not in use anymore, but is kept for backwards compatibility.  rAI     
[4] OCTET STRING (SIZE (6)) OPTIONAL,   -- The Routeing Area Identifier (RAI) in the current SGSN is coded in accordance with   -- 3GPP TS 24.008 [41] without the Routing Area Identification IEI (only the   -- last 6 octets are used).  gsmLocation   
[5] GSMLocation OPTIONAL,  umtsLocation  [6] UMTSLocation OPTIONAL,  sAI     
[7] OCTET STRING (SIZE (7)) OPTIONAL,   -- format: PLMN-ID 3 octets (no. 1-3),   -- LAC 2 octets (no. 4-5),   -- SAC 2 octets (no. 6-7)   -- (according to 3GPP TS 25.413 [82])  ...,  oldRAI    
[8] OCTET STRING (SIZE (6)) OPTIONAL   -- the "Routeing Area Identifier" in the old SGSN is coded in accordance with   -- 3GPP TS 24.008 [41] without the Routing Area Identification IEI   -- (only the last 6 octets are used).   -- This parameter is duplicated from 3GPP TS 33.108 [61] }  If a C(L)SP provides the services listed in clause 5.1.3, this location information definition may be insufficiently 
defined for a C(L)SP to provide meaningful information to the LEA. The C(L)SP may not know the target Cloud 
Service User's location or if known, it may not be able to provide the location information in the format defined. Since 

the location information is based on the underlying access tec
hnology (e.g. Tetra, GSM, UMTS), the CSP providing the 
target Cloud Service User access to the Cloud (i.e. Cloud Carrier per NIST SP 500-292 [i.22]), can provide the location 

information as defined in the existing parameter. 
If location reporting is authorized for a specific service, th
e C(L)SP is obligated to report the location of the target 
Cloud Service User to the LEA. However, it is uncertain what information the C(L)SP has that relates to the 
"geographic, physical or logical locatio
n" of the target Cloud Service User. 
The location information definition should be reviewed to determine if modification is needed to make it usable for a 
C(L)SP. 
6.5.7 Target Identification 
As mentioned in clause 5.4, the target of lawful interception may have several different network or service identities, 

depending on the network or service provider and type of interception being accomplished. 
Each service provider, either CSP or C(L)SP, will have an ability to identify a particular subscriber or client. That 
identification may be one of the identifiers listed in Figure 5-
2. It may also be a type of 
security credential or other 
identity management authentication. 
Target identity(ies) may not traverse or be shared across di
fferent network or service providers. This may impact the 
ability of a service provider to isolate the target's communications to the exclusion of non-target communications. 

A C(L)SP providing a conferencing service to a target of 
interception may provide service based on a log-in/password 
authentication while a CSP providing the target's mobile acce
ss to the network may use equi
pment identification in its 
authentication and authorization procedures
. Neither service provider may be aware of the target's identity used in a 
network other than its own nor therefore, the binding between the two may not exist or be maintained. Dynamic 
Triggering may assist in the dynamic binding of target identities across network domains. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 31 6.5.8 Correlation 
Independent of interception type, LI solutions are compri
sed of Intercept Related Information (IRI) and Communication 
Content (CC). Correlation refers to the ability to associate the IRI with the CC. As stated in clause 5.4.2, different (or 
multiple) service providers may have access to the target's traffic. In the example in clause 5.4.6, the C(L)SP providing 

a conferencing service may have access to the IRI while th
e CSP providing the mobile network may have access to the 
CC. However, in this case, the mobile CSP may not be able to separate the conferencing CC. 
6.5.9 Network Virtualization 
LI needs on the network remain whether or not the network element is virtualized or not. As network functions are 

virtualized, operators and vendors need to ensure that the LI functionality is always available and that the integrity, 

correctness and security of LI information that crosses in
ternal and external network interfaces are not adversely 
impacted. 
6.6 Mobile Networks 
6.6.1 Introduction 
Network functions in mobile networks can also be virtualized. Use cases that address the 3GPP mobile network 
architecture can be found in ETSI GS NFV 001 [i.17]. 
Annex A provides a non-exhaustive list of use cases, to include those for Mobile Cloud Services. These use cases fall 
into four categories. 
6.6.2 Non-MNO transited Cloud Applications/Services  
Cloud applications or services that may not transit the MNO facilities (data in motion) are not considered in this clause.

 6.6.4 Cloud Applications/Services Transit MNO via Proxies 
Service that are proxied in the network may be handled in current systems, such as Session Border Controllers (SBC), 
Packet Data Gateways (PDG), backend Web services and may not require input from 3GPP. However existing Intercept 
Access Points (IAP) and collection and delivery functions may need augmentation to support these services: 
• Location information reporting. When a user's device has simultaneous access over both Wi-Fi and the cellular 
networks, the network may receive location information from the PDG and the Mobile network. It is uncertain 

which location is reported or if both locations are reported. 
• New IRI messages may be required. 
• Different implementation and support via NNI to Cloud Servers.

 6.7 Mobile Networks 
6.7.1 General 
This clause derives needs from the Use Cases for Operators to deploy Branded Mobile Cloud Solutions that meet the 
various regional regulatory lawful access obligations. This clause only deals with those cases that transit MNO facilities 

as identified in clause 5.5.  
In general not all regulatory domains have the same lawful access obligations. The present document will assume the 
most stringent needs such that any specification created 
or modified will support the requirements, while regional 
implementation can deal with the capability in regional variations or optional parameter settings. It has to be noted that 

if a new field or parameter in ETSI TS 133 107 [i.12] is needed, ETSI TS 133 108 [i.19], then it is mandatory that it is 

to be included in the specification. However the delivery of the information to LEA may be optional depending on the 

regional differences. 
6.7.2 Mobile Cloud  
Lawful access obligations vary by national regulations, bu
t generally include interception of private communications, 
disclosure and retention of an operator's subscriber informat
ion and their services. These needs are described in national 
laws and regulations and also define the instruments required to invoke access. Other regulation may define the 

qualification of a Communications Service Provider (CSP). 
Each of these aspects of lawful access has different technical
 needs. The derived needs in the present document should 
be viewed only in terms of interception or data in motion across a 3GPP network as outlined in ETSI TS 133 106 [i.11]. 
Granted, some or all the needs may be used by other systems that support retention and or disclosure or are subject to 
search and seizure. 
The definition of a "Subject of investigation" may vary by national regulation and may evolve over time. A Subject's 
service may be any communication, feature or function that opera
tes on behalf of the Subject even if the Subject is not 
presently communicating with the service, examples, emai
l, voice mail and Cloud services like file sharing. 
6.7.3 General  
ETSI TS 133 106 [i.11] describes the obligations of LEA's for mobile networks. The following list is derived after some 

analysis in the use cases from annex A. 
[R001] MNO provided Cloud services (White labelled or in house) require lawful access. 
[R002] Lawful access may extend to MNO services that transgress the operator domain (non 3GPP access 
Domains).  
[R003] Lawful access occurs in the regulatory Domain of the MNO. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 35 [R004] Lawful access may occur in the regulatory domain
 of the Cloud Service if supported and authorized. 
[R005] MNO provided Cloud service provides the capability to provide IRI and Content related intercepts. 
[R006] MNO is required to assist the LEA to provide content in the clear of a provided Cloud service.  

[R007] Lawful access is not detectable by the subject 
and or the subject services or others users.   
[R008] Lawful access reports the location.   

[R009]      Lawful access reports all identities used by the subject.  
[R010] Lawful access reports access to the subject's Cloud service by others.   
[R011] A Cloud service identifier should be available to aid collection systems.   
NOTE: If there are multiple Cloud services and vendors providing different services for the MNO, an identifier 
may assist LEA in future investigate work. Disclosure from the MNO may not identify uniquely the 
Cloud service. Retention services might be able to determine the Cloud Services and end points (the IP 
address may not be static or may change due to DNS query and cache location of servers) If there are 
multiple proxies used as outline in [R017] the identifier might assist in future search and seizure 

activities. 
6.7.4 Proxy 
[R012] Session timers (Time to Live) should be set to allow proxy systems to be able transpose address.   
NOTE 1: Concerns could arise whether changing the messag
es results in contamination of evidence and if S or 
CSCF do this anyway as B2B user agents, clarification may be required. Also note that the user may 

never get the file and there may never be a retry. The service may not indicate the failure so the LEA may 
have the file and the user may not, if the proxy requests the file as per use case located in annex A. 
[R013] Any hashes used by the Cloud service should be known to the proxy, such that reconstructed addresses 
can be created without errors. 
[R014] If the proxy and Cloud client report non 3GPP access parameters, they should be provided as IRI. 
[R015] The proxy reports the IP addresses used by the subject. 

[R016] The proxy is uniquely identified in lawful access messages. 
[R017] The network should allow multiple proxies to be deployed in a MNO network, allowing redundancy and 
reducing latency.   
NOTE 2: Data retention is not addressed, additionally a proxy may request copies of files in separate messages if 
the content is delivered from the Cloud service directly from the CSP and not through the proxy.  
6.7.5 ANDSF 
[R018] It should be possible to configure policies for subjects on the fly to restrict Cloud and MNO base services 
to be kept with the MNO network. 
[R019] The change in policies should be undetectable by the subject or the subject services.   
[R020] The IP addressed used for non-3GPP access is captured. 

[R021] The ANDSF client should report additional 
information such as SSID, Local IP address. 
NOTE: The ANDSF client or client server may have add
itional information in regard
s to the user location as 
policies are used to steer traffic to particular Wi-Fi access networks, including SSID.

-01) 36 7 Traditional LI models and methods applied to the 
Cloud environment 
7.1 Introduction 
As described in clause 5, network virtualization and Cloud services of existing telecommunications services for which 
there are LI handover specifications can generally use thos
e specifications and associated models to meet handover 
obligations. This clause describes those specifications and how they can be adapted to the Cloud environment, together 

with extensions to the models that can be used for newer services. 
7.2 Traditional LI models 
The diagrams of annex E (informative) of ETSI TS 101 331 [i.1] may provide a conceptual foundation for Cloud 

services LI. 
LI models for telecommunications services are currently found in: 
• ETSI TS 101 671, "Lawful Interception (LI); Handover interface for the lawful interception of 
telecommunications traffic [i.2]; 
• ETSI TS 102 232-2: "Lawful Interception (LI); Handover Interface and Service-Specific Details (SSD) for IP 

delivery; Part 2: Service-specific details for Messaging services" [i.4]; 
• ETSI TS 102 232-3: "Lawful Interception (LI); Handover Interface and Service-Specific Details (SSD) for IP 
delivery; Part 3: Service-specific details for internet access services" [i.5]; 
• ETSI TS 102 232-4: "Lawful Interception (LI); Handover Interface and Service-Specific Details (SSD) for IP 
delivery; Part 4: Service-specific details for Layer 2 services" [i.6]; 
• ETSI TS 102 232-5: "Lawful Interception (LI); Handover Interface and Service-Specific Details (SSD) for IP 

delivery; Part 5: Service-specific details for IP Multimedia services" [i.7]. 
The standard handover interface developed by TC LI for LEA/CSP use is depicted in Figure 7-1. 
 Figure 7-1: Standard CSP-LEA interface for traditional services 
7.3 Adaptation to the Cloud environment 
Irrespective of how the services are provided, obligations for 
LEA necessitate the interception of designated traffic in a 
secure and trusted manner sufficient to meet any applicable judicial evidence obligations, as expeditiously as possible. 

Examples are depicted in Figure 7-2. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 37  Figure 7-2: Adaptation of LI to the Cloud Environment 
7.4 Handover Interfaces for new Cloud services 
The basic request-response interface demarcation between the LEA and CSP will continue to exist. However, what gets 
transferred across that interface is likely to be fundamentally different. Applications, services and the available 

information expected to be returned by 
the C (L) SP are generally very different in the new Cloud services described in 
clause 5. 
There are no existing specifications for describing and structur
ing Cloud targets, applications and available LI response 
information. 
7.5 Handover interfaces for vi
rtualized network elements 
Handover interfaces between the LEA and CSP will continue to exist. 
7.6 Hybrid Services 
7.6.1 Introduction 
Hybrid Cloud services are a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain unique 
entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability 
(e.g. Cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds). 
7.6.2 Volte 
Given the options in how certain network elements can be deployed and how they may be geographically shared it is 

possible that a combination of traditional telecommunications and Cloud LI techniques may be required e.g. centralized 

HSS or TAS. 
7.6.3 Peer to Peer Services 
Some peer to peer services only contact a centralized point to ensure they know what IP address to use to contact 
another user - the media is not routed via any easily predic
table infrastructure. However this setup information may, if 
structured correctly and unencrypted allow the various CSPs intercept the traffic. See Figure 7-3.

-01) 38  Figure 7-3: Peer to Peer call/session flow 
7.7 Cloud Lawful Intercept
ion Function (CLIF) 
In order to maintain LI production capabilities, a C (L) SP can implement a Cloud Lawful Interception Function 
(CLIF). 
Table 7-1 describes CLIF use cases to accommodate implementation challenges.

but service is made available within jurisdiction

Cloud based provider within the LEA jurisdiction 

with service carried internally 
Although the LEA may be able to force the Cloud service provider to 
intercept within its own infrastructure, it may be better to also use the 
a CLIF - thus maintaining standard interfaces, capabilities and 
coverage 
 8 Security of LI in a Cloud or Network Virtualized 
environment 
8.1 Lawful Interception security 
Existing LI specifications include extensive security capabilities. See Handover specification for IP delivery, ETSI 
TS 102 232-1 [i.3]. Some comparable secure delivery capability is necessary for the Cloud service environment - not 
only for delivery, but for requests such as warrants described in ETSI TR 103 690 [i.8]. 
Additional LI security capabilities may also need to be specified relating to avoidance of detection and 
compartmentalization of LI implementations in Cloud services environments. 
National regulations may identify specific security practices and needs. Generally, LI mechanisms, capabilities and 
operations are provided protection from disclosure to unauthorized personnel (e.g. the target, other subscribers, CSP 

employees not involved in LI activities). LI activities should be accomplished in an undetectable manner. CSPs develop 
security practices and procedures. Handover of intercepte
d product is typically done in a secure, reliable manner, 
utilizing encryption or secure transfer protocols, to ensure data integrity. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 39 8.2 Cloud services security 
C (L) SPs ensure that their infrastructure is secure and that
 client data and applications are protected. This is done 
through security controls to prevent at
tacks and mitigate vulnerabilities, detect
 attacks and reduce data/resource loss and 
damage in the event of an attack or security compromise. 
C (L) SPs will need to manage access control for client information and computing resources, restricting unauthorized 
access. Private or sensitive data may require additional 
security. Digital identities and credentials are protected. 
Aggregation of customer data or activity produced may also require additional protection. 
C (L) SPs and their customers may have to compliance with national laws concerning various issues such as contracts, 
e-discovery, privacy or stored and personal information 
(e.g. credit cards, health information). These may require 
maintaining logs and audit trails, which themselves may require additional security. 
For purposes of the present document, Cloud services security consists of capabilities that enable the assessment and 
mitigation of risks associated with those services and the supporting infrastructures. Security capabilities of interest for 

Lawful Interception purposes generally encompass either Iden
tity Management or security related implementations that 
enable or facilitate acquisition of traffic or patterns of interest. 
The Cloud security work is spread across many of the 
forums identified in annex B and constantly evolving. 
In regards to the Cloud legal aspects, it is to be expected that many Cloud computing scenarios will span the laws of 
multiple jurisdictions that may all potentially apply. 
The same data may be processed in multiple jurisdictions at the same time and the actual location of a user's data may 
be difficult to determine. 
The combinatorial character of the mobile Cloud services, across multiple resource domains, infrastructure domains, 
security domains and jurisdictions domains, makes the task of developing LI solutions for Cloud services particularly 
challenging. 
The market opportunities of the mobile Cloud services might
 be impeded, for the 3GPP mobile operators, by some 
conditions of their operating licenses, like the regulatory obligations for LI that are an intrinsic part of any operational 
license. 
Even if not specifically spelled out for Cloud services cases, as the mobile operator domain is a component of the 
combination of domains that contributes to the feasibility and delivery of the Cloud services, the LI obligations are most 
likely to be implicitly extended by the regulators to Cloud services. 
8.3 Security Considerations in a Virtualized Network 
Environment  A CSP or C (L) SP may implement network virtualization within their own architecture or may outsource portions of 
their virtual network to other providers. In either case, the security needs to protect LI capabilities and operations 
remain the same, independent of any level of virtualization. 
9 LI - Cloud gaps and challenges 
9.1 Generic Cloud LI interface specification gap 
The present document is intended to provide an initial overview of Cloud LI, to include mobile operators that provide 

white labelled or Branded Mobile Cloud Services. Challenges
 to support lawful access of services are identified and 
discussed. The present document focuses on Interception of data in motion and any missing elements from current 

Specifications. 
The use cases in annex A were analysed and from these non-exhaustive lists of use cases three scenarios emerged: 
• Scenario 1: Cloud Services not transiting the network or remain wholly within the network's facilities, 
• Scenario 2: Cloud Services that transit the network facilities via proxy, 
• Scenario 3: Cloud Services that transit the network facilities via policies. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 40 In Scenario 1, these services should be supported by ETSI and any LI documents generated from the present document. 
Integration or aspects of functions required with ETSI TS 133 106 [i.11], ETSI TS 133 107 [i.12], ETSI 

TS 133 108 [i.19] are beyond the scope of the present document.  
If it is determined that new work is needed, the following should be considered: 
a) How location, Cloud application identity, IMS interaction are reported for those services supported. 

b) If the Mobile Cloud service is in a different Regulatory Domain and supports ETSI and is supported thro
ugh mutual legal assistance instruments. 
c) If the Mobile Cloud service is in a different Regulatory Domain and supports ETSI LI Cloud collection and is 
supported through mutual legal assistance instruments and supports dynamic triggering. 
d) Incorporation of any Derived Obligations from clause 5. 
However, there remains an important obvious need for a specification that establishes a generic interface for Cloud 
services. Large data centres are expanding worldwide and transforming the service provisioning globally. Components 
of that environment, such as "application"-based services, complicate the challenges. 
Considering this significant exponential scaling of Cloud service environment, generic specification between C (L) SPs, 
CSPs and LEAs is essential for all parties. It should include a structured trusted means to request LI capabilities and 

receive a response as well as best practices for implementations. The Cloud LI Function identified in clauses 5 and 6, 

above, represents a common, generic, infrastructure-based approach. 
9.2 Specific Cloud LI specification gaps 
9.2.1 General 
Scenarios 2 and 3 may require additional specification(s) or CSP/C (L) SPs may benefit from a best practices or 

implementation guide. 
9.2.2 Scenario 2: Cloud Services that
 transit the network facilities via 
Proxy 
It is left to implementation how a mobile operator will meet their lawful access obligations. The present document 

illustrates several examples in the Use Cases that may be used. The Uses Case where not exhaustive and there may be 

other implementations. However from the list provided the following issues were noted: 
a) Location information reporting. When a user's device has simultaneous access over both Wi-Fi and the cellular 
networks, the network may receive location information from the PDG and the Mobile network. It is uncertain 

which location is reported or if both locations are reported. 
b) New IRI messages may be required. 
9.2.3 Scenario 3: Cloud Services that
 transit the network facilities via 
Policies 
With the introduction of access Network Discovery and Se
lection Function (ANDSF) it is
 possible for an MNO to 
specify which application is routed through the MNO ne
twork while accessing hotspots or other Wi-Fi/IP networks. 

Work is still progressing in this area. However from the list provided the following issues were noted: 
a) Location information reporting. When a user's device has simultaneous access over both Wi-Fi and the cellular 
networks, the network may receive location information from the PDG and the Mobile network. It is uncertain 

which location is reported or if both locations are reported. 
b) If new IRI messages are required for some Cloud Services. 
c) Whether a Subject and or the Subject's Cloud 
Service can detect invocation of lawful access. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 41 9.2.4 Target Identity ex
pressions for Cloud LI  
Unlike the traditional telecommunications and Internet environments, target identities, in a Cloud environment are 
unlikely to be well structured and are frequently temporary. With more than two million applications and other Cloud 
services and expansion rates of 10 % per month, the identities of targets may vary significantly. Indeed, in some Cloud 

services, a target identity may consist only of a set of attributes that collectively can be associated with a specific 

individual. 
There is a compelling need to develop an extensible structured
 expression for a "virtual target identity" that enables law 
enforcement and CSPs/C(L)SPs to effectively describe a target in a Cloud environments. This should expand how target 
identities are currently defined. Without such a structured expression, it is not possible to describe the desired target and 
every request becomes a "free form" text description th
at is difficult and costly to produce and implement. 
9.2.5 Application Identity expressions for Cloud LI 
Similar to the virtual target identity challenge/gap described above, in a Cloud environment, the applications number in 

the hundreds of thousands and are constantly changing. Some applications may also be malware. 
A number of organizations and vendors are attempting to develop means for instantiating virtual service application 
identities in conjunction with traffic management, cybersecurity and LI. Even more advanced in the area of application 
identities is the structure expression work progressed by US government agencies for describing malware known as the 
Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC). 
This language specification is also scheduled to be 
adopted by the ITU-T as Recommendation ITU-T X.1546 [i.18]. 
There is a compelling need to develop an extensible structured expression for a "virtual application identity" that 
enables law enforcement to effectively describe an appli
cation in a Cloud environment. Without such a structured 
expression, it is not possible to describe the service applica
tion associated with the target and every request becomes a 
"free form" text description that is difficult and costly to produce and implement. A new work item to produce this 

specification seems appropriate. 
9.2.6 Virtual Observable (VO) expressions for Cloud LI 
In a Cloud environment, available information, whether LI content or IRI associated with the virtual target identity, is 

usually very diverse, associated with applications that are not well understood or acquired from many kinds of 

distributed network resources. The information of interest may also include complex resource use signatures within the 

virtualization environment. 
One of the significant emerging means for capturing and 
exchanging this information is the creation of a common 
modular structured specification for "observables" known as Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX
TM).  It can form the 
basis for TC LI work for a Virtual Observable expression for Cloud LI. 
NOTE: From:
 http://cybox.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#A1
: CybOXŽ is a standardized language for representing 
cyber observables, whether from observation in the operational cyber domain or as patterns of 
observables that could be observed. Cyber observables are events or stateful properties that occur or may 
occur, in the operational cyber domain, such as the value of a registry key, deletion of a file or the receipt 
of an http GET. 
There is a compelling need to develop an extensible struct
ured expression for "virtual observables" that enables the 
acquisition and handover of information in a Cloud environment. Without such a structured expression, it is not possible 

for a C(L)SP or CSP to respond to a LEA request with information associated with the target. Every response becomes 

a "free form" text description that is di
fficult and costly to process by LEAs. 
9.2.7 CLIF Specifications 
In relatively static, traditional network environments, a common set of handover interface (HI) specifications for 
receiving and responding to structured expressions for LEA 
Lawful Interception production requests have been widely 
used over many years. Additionally, an Intercept Access Point is necessary to provide coverage for the services to be 
intercepted. However, in a Cloud-NFV environment, the equivalent capabilities will likely be scattered across many 

different physical and virtual infrastructures - under the control of diverse users and providers, as well as subject to 

different legal jurisdictions. The associated resources are 
frequently transient and may not have loci specified by 
traditional network-based identifiers. The development of CLIF specifications is essential to maintaining LEA LI 
obligations. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 42 10 LI - Network Virtualization gaps and challenges 
In NFV, exact physical deploy
ment of a VNF instance on the infrastructure is not visible from the end-to-end service 
perspective, with the exception of guaranteeing specific policy constraints. VNF instances and their supporting 
infrastructure need to be visible for configuration, diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes ETSI GS NFV 002 [i.13]. 
Some areas to be analysed include when network functions are virtualized: 
• The need to identify and report service instance(s). 
• If network node (i.e. IAPs/ICEs) identities are affected. 
• If additional LI functionality is needed in the NFV Management and Orchestration functions. 
11 Conclusions and Recommendations 
Major gaps and challenges exist that are increasingly larger
 with respect to enabling law enforcement to request and 
receive Cloud/virtualization information. The gaps go substantially beyond Cloud/virtualization networks and services. 
Traditional LI approaches in dedicated service architectures like telephony are largely irrelevant in a world involving 

multiple service providers, as well as unknown and constantly changing architectures, applications and devices. 
Service and network architectures are non-monolithic, with 
multiple operators involved in supplying a service to a 
single user. It is not unusual for the service provider at the application/signalling layer to be different from the access 
provider. In addition, for some services it is necessary to have the option to perform interception in the core network 

where there is not always a link between the identifiers used
 in the application layer and the identifiers used in the 
access / transport domain (generally IP Address).  
Cloud/virtualization implementations with a large number of constantly moving smart phones, tablets and similar 
devices using diverse and distributed applications and related 
services, take the challenges to a whole new level. It is 
essential to develop new future-proof, infrastructure-agnostic means for law enforcement to specify the acquisition of 
available real-time case intelligence information from diverse information sources using actor-specific application 

patterns and correlate that information. At the same time, these means allow for considerable flexibility among service, 

Cloud and network providers, vendors and trusted third parties in determining exactly how they will comply with an LI 
order from government authority within their facilities. 
The cyber threat intelligence community is also facing an almost identical challenge in the acquisition, integration and 
exchange of real-time attack information. That community 
provides structured information exchange approaches that 
also meet law enforcement needs. By leveraging the cyber threat intelligence community platforms, the law 

enforcement community can enhance its own capabilities with this major development activity and reduce redundancies 

or disparate approaches.

Several Use cases A.1 Telepresence use case 1: TSP offers Telepresence 
and all participants are su
bscribers of the TSP 
a) Overview 
1) This use case describes basic telepresence service. A TSP offers Telepresence and all the participants are 
subscribers to that TSP. 
b) Actors 
1) The users are Jean (the subject of the lawful interception) and her two associates: Greg and Peter. 
2) McCloud is the mobile TSP/Cloud service provider providing a Telepresence Service. 

3) The Alleghany County Police department is the LE
A authorized to perform the electronic surveillance. 
c) Preconditions 
1) Jean, Greg and Peter all are subscribers of the McCloud Telepresence services. 

2) The Alleghany County Police Department as obtained the lawful authorization to perform electronic 
surveillance on Jean, who is suspected of involvement with some illegal activity. 
3) The Alleghany County Police Department has provided McCloud with this lawful authorization for 
assistance in intercepting Jean's communications, which includes use of McCloud's Telepresence service. 
4) McCloud is able to deliver intercepted communicati
ons of its Telepresence Service to authorized LEAs. 
5) Jean, Greg and Peter all are using UEs which are active on the McCloud network. However, each has 
different video display capabilities. 
d) Actions 
1) Jean initiates Telepresence (conference) session with Greg and Peter. 

2) Jean, not having extensive video administration experience, relies heavily on the McCloud Help Desk 
Service for assistance in using the service (e.g. to initiate and troubleshoot problems) while Peter and 
Greg join her in the Telepresence meeting. 
3) Peter and Greg accept the invitation to join the Te
lepresence session and are added to the conference. 
4) The McCloud surveillance facilities identify that a target of LI has initiated communication covered by 
the LI authorization and begins delivery of the communication to the LEA. 
5) The Alleghany County Police Department begins r
eceiving Jean's intercepted communications (i.e. IRI 
and CC for all required services as identified in the lawful authorization). The IRI and CC for the 
Telepresence service is delivered separately and the CC is the media that is sent to/from Jean (the 

Subject). 
6) Jean, Peter and Greg discuss criminal activities they are planning, showing maps and pictures of the 
criminal venue (e.g. bank and surrounding streets for their "get-away"). Greg shows a short silent movie 

clip of the bank guards to show their routine and guard positions. 
7) McCloud's Telepresence Service adapts the video delivery to each UE based on the UE capabilities and 
for network optimization. 
8) Peter's UE display is small and he is unable to see the important details of the video that Greg is sharing, 
since he is unable to zoom in for a closer view. 
9) The Telepresence session ends. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 44 e) Results 
1) Jean, Grep and Peter have finalized their plans for illegal activity and were unaware that any LI had 
occurred. 
2) The Alleghany County Police Department received the IRI and CC of Jean's communications. Using that 
information in their investigations, 
they prevent a crime from occurring. 
3) Met their regulatory obligation to unobtrusively deliver communication to the authorized LEA.  
f) LI Discussion/Challenges 
1) McCloud has a legal obligation to provide LI for the Telepresence session. Whether the video is provided 
to Law Enforcement is a national option. At a minimum, the audio of this conference, as well as the IRI 
is required to be reported, as Telepresence is a c
onference per 3GPP definition. The exact set of events 
and information is outside the scope of this use case 
(as SA3-LI has not yet discussed/agreed/defined LI 
for Telepresence). 
2) The identities of the participants are known to McCloud, as they are all subscribers to McCloud's 
Telepresence service. The McCloud Telepresence Service has the service logic for Jean's Telepresence 

session, the identities of the participants and access to the media. 
3) As with any other service lawfully intercepted, if McCloud provides encryption for the Telepresence 
Service, McCloud is responsible for either decryp
ting or providing the keys to law enforcement to 
decrypt. 
A.2 Telepresence use case 2: Telepresence is offered by 
a Third Party provider. Participants are subscribers of 
the same or different TSP(s) 
a) Overview 
1) This use case describes basic telepresence service. The mobile TSP acts as a "Cloud carrier" for the 
Cloud provider's Telepresence service. 
b) Actors 
1) The users are Jean (the subject of the lawful interception) and her two associates: Gabor and Terry. 
2) McCloud is the mobile TSP/Cloud carrier. Jean and Terry are subscribers of McCloud. 
3) McCloud provides Jean with mobile broadband and voice services. 

4) ExcellAlex Mobile is a mobile TSP. Gabor is a subscriber of ExcellAlex Mobile. 

5) TellyServ is a (third party) Cloud service provider providing the Telepresence Service. TellyServ is NOT 
offering Telepresence Service on McCloud's behalf nor does TellyServ have any business relationship 
with McCloud. 
6) Jean, Terry and Gavor all subscribe to TellySErv's Telepresence Service. 
7) The Maryland State Police do not provide ExcellAlex M
obile a lawful authorization as it is not providing 
a service to Jean (the Subject). 
c) Preconditions 
1) The Maryland State Police has obtained legal authority to perform electronic surveillance on Jean, who is 
suspected of involvement in illegal activity. 
2) The Maryland State Police has provided McCloud and TellyServ with this lawful authorization for 
assistance in intercepting Jean's communications. 
3) McCloud and TellyServ both are able to deliver
 intercepted communications to authorized LEAs. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 45 4) The Maryland State Police do not provide ExcellAlex M
obile a lawful authorization as it is not providing 
a service to Jean (the Subject). 
5) Jean and Terry are using UEs that are active on the McCloud network. Gabor is using a UE that is active 
on ExcellAlex Mobile. All three UEs (Jean's, Terry's and Gabor's) are active with TellyServ to use the 
Telepresence Service. 
d) Actions 
1) Jean initiates a Telepresence (conference) session with Gabor and Terry. 
2) Jean, not having extensive video administration experience, relies heavily on the TellyServ's Help Desk 
Service for assistance in using the service (e.g. to 
set-up the meeting and troubleshoot problems) while 
Gabor and Terry join her in the Telepresence meeting.  
3) Terry and Gabor accept Jean's invitation to join the Telepresence session and are added to the 
conference. 
4) McCloud surveillance functions identify that a target of LI has initiated a communication covered by 
their lawful authorization (i.e. broadband data access, SMS and VoIP) and begin delivery of the 
communications to the LEA. Note some of the TellyServ Telepresence is delivered as part of the 

McCloud's mobile broadband intercepted communications. 
5) TellyServ surveillance functions identify that a target of LI has initiated a communication covered by 
their lawful authorization (i.e. Telepresence) and begin delivery of the communications to the LEA. 
6) The Maryland State Police begin receiving Jean's 
intercepted communications (i.e. IRI and CC) from 
both McCloud and TellyServ. 
7) Jean, Terry and Gabor discuss criminal activities, showing maps and pictures of the criminal venue (e.g. 
bank and surrounding streets for their "get-away"). Gabor shows a short silent movie clip of the bank 

guards to show their routine and guard positions. 
8) The telepresence session ends. 
e) Results 
1) Jean, Terry and Gavor finalized their plans for illegal activity and were unaware that any LI had 
occurred. 
2) Jean was also unaware of the LI on her broadband access. 
3) The Maryland State Police received the IRI and CC of Jean's communications. Using that information in 
their investigations, they prevent a crime from occurring. 
4) McCloud met their regulatory obligation to unobtrusively deliver intercepted communications to the 
authorized LEA. 
5) TellyServ met their regulatory obligation to unobtrusively deliver intercepted communications to the 
authorized LEA. 
f) LI Discussion/Challenges 
1) McCloud has a legal obligation to provide LI for the services that they offer the target. In this use case, 
they do not offer the Telepresence Service, so they ar
e not obligated to provide separate delivery of this 
service. Since it is "available" in Jean's packet data 
stream, it is delivered as part of McCloud's packet 
data interception. McCloud isolates and reports Jean's
 intercepted voice, SMS and packet data/broadband 
services per their LI solutions. McCloud uses the identifiers that are available in their services and 
network. 
2) TellyServ has the legal obligation to provide LI for the services that they offer the target. In this use case, 
this is only the Telepresence Service. They provide the CII and CC for the Telepresence service per their 
LI solution and suing the identifiers that are used
 in the Telepresence Service. TellyServ knows the 
identities of the participants; they have the service logic and access the media. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 46 3) As with any other service lawfully intercepted, 
if TellyServ provides encryption for the Telepresence 
Service, TellyServ is responsible for either decrypting or providing the keys to law enforcement to 
decrypt. 
A.3 Virtual Machine Image (VMI) Basic Use Case 
a) Overview 
1) This use case describes basic VMI operation when the image is explicitly created by the user. 
b) Actors 
1) The user is John. 
2) McCloud is the Cloud service provider providing IaaS on a variety of target hardware platforms but a 
single hypervisor (VMM). 
c) Preconditions 
1) John is a subscriber of the McCloud services and has VMI management privileges for private, shared and 
public images. 
2) John begins with a public VMI with LINUX OS in initialized state. 
d) Actions 
1) John selects a public VMI which has LINUX and appropriate application libraries initialized to run on a 
specific target machine type. 
2) John installs and initializes an application which manages his illegal activity. 
3) John then initiates a VM snapshot to save the VM state as a new shared VMI. 
4) John's cohorts are then able to logon to the new VM under the standard LINUX login services that John 
manages. 
5) John also distributes the VMI name for other groups engaged in illegal activity to also use. 
e) Results 
1) There is a VM environment operating under John's control supporting the purposes of the illegal activity. 
2) The VMI which is tailored for illegal activity is available for other groups to also support other illegal 
activity. 
f) Challenges for interception 
1) The VMI is hardware and VMM specific. The target
 hardware platform may be Cloud service provider 
specific. 
2) The identities of the users of the VM may not be known to the Cloud service provider since the user 
identity management on the VM is by the system administrator of the hosted OS. 
3) The identities of the VMIs are Cloud service provider, VMM specific. 
4) Identifying the target OS may not be known by the Cloud service provider, but require parsing the VMI. 

5) Identifying relevant data may require reverse engi
neering the application since the source code may not 
be available and then parsing the VMI.

a) Overview 
1) This use case describes basic VMI operation when the file system or database of interest is in the main 
memory of the VM as opposed to residing on a structured mass storage element. 
b) Actors 
1) The user is John.  
2) McCloud is the Cloud service provider providing IaaS or PaaS on a variety of target hardware platforms 
but a single hypervisor (VMM). 
c) Preconditions 
1) John is a subscriber of the McCloud services and has installed an in memory file system and database 
system on the OS running in the selected VM. 
d) Actions 
1) John activates the VMI with the in memory file and database systems/ 

2) John installs and initializes an application which manages his illegal activity. 

3) John's cohorts are then able to logon to the new VM under the standard LINUX login services that John 
manages. 
e) Results 
1) All of the state (data) of the illegal activity 
are contained within the VM image or the active VM. 
f) Challenges for interception 
1) The VMI is hardware and VMM specific. The target
 hardware platform may be Cloud service provider 
specific. 
2) The identities of the users of the VM may not be known to the Cloud service provider since the user 
identity management on the VM is by the system administrator of the hosted OS. 
3) Identifying the target OS may not be known by the Cloud service provider, but require parsing the VMI. 
4) Identifying relevant data may require reverse engineering the application since the source code may not 
be available, parsing the file and database systems and then parsing the VMI. 
5) The VMI created by the user or the latest VMI created for user triggered check pointing, may not contain 
the most current data of interest. Rather that it exists in the active VM. 
A.5 Distributed Application Communicating through IPC  
a) Overview 
1) This use case describes an application which is distributed across multiple VMs hosted by the same 
Cloud service provider. The distributed parts of the application communicate through an Inter Process 
Communication (IPC) service. 
b) Actors 
1) The user is John.  
2) McCloud is the Cloud service provider providing IaaS or PaaS on a variety of target hardware platforms 
but a single hypervisor (VMM). 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 48 c) Preconditions 
1) John is a subscriber of the McCloud services and has installed an OS with an IPC mechanism built on 
top of a McCloud proprietary inter-VM messaging service which is not based on TCP/IP. 
d) Actions 
1) John activates the VMI with the McCloud proprietary inter-VM messaging service supporting the hosted 
OS IPC service. 
2) John installs and initializes an application which manages his illegal activity. 
3) One of the VM contains the data which is used by the illegal activity. 

4) Another VM not identifiable with John handles the login in and user interactions with other members of 
the illegal activity. 
5) John's cohorts are then able to logon to the new VM under the standard LINUX login services that John 
manages. 
6) The VM handling the user interface aspects communicates with the VM containing the illegal activity 
data VM through the IPC mechanism. 
e) Results 
1) Multiple VMs are involved with supporting the illegal 
activity. Not all of them can be linked directly 
with John by only examining McCloud subscriber records. 
f) Challenges for interception 
1) The VMI is hardware and VMM specific. The target
 hardware platform may be Cloud service provider 
specific. 
2) The identities of the users of the VM may not be known to the Cloud service provider since the user 
identity management on the VM is by the system administrator of the hosted OS. 
3) Identifying the target OS may not be known by the Cloud service provider, but require parsing the VMI. 
4) To get a complete picture of the illegal activity, multiple VMs or VMIs will have to be parsed. 
5) The contents of the messaging IPC between VMs is application specific. This would require reverse 
engineering the application running on all th
e VMs where the application is distributed. 
A.6 Mobile Portal or Dashboard using both Operator 
Provided and Enterprise Applications  
a) Overview 
1) This use case describes a portal or dashboard which integrates access to different applications for a user 
for a consistent and efficient user experience. Most
 of these applications are not aware of the other 
applications integrated in
to the portal or dashboard interface and may not directly interact with each 
other. The challenge is that many of the applications can be independently deployed in many different 
environments. 
b) Actors 
1) Joe is the user. He works for Company X and is a 
subscriber of Operator Y. He uses the dashboard 
software as a productivity tool as part of his job. 
2) Company X is a Fortune 500 company. Its internal Cloud based services are hosted internally. 
3) Operator Y is a wireless operator. Its commercial Cloud based services are hosted internally. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1
 (2016
-01) 49 c) Preconditions

Operator Y. It uses Cloud based directory services and instant messaging provided by Company X. 
2) For all applications, the appli
cation server is accessed either through an SOA framework or through a 
proprietary API. 
3) Joe's Company X identity and credentials to access Co
mpany X services is not the same as his Operator 
Y identity and credentials. 
4) LEA P has obtained a warrant to intercept Joe's 
communication through Operat
or Y, delivered it to 
Operator Y and Operator Y has activated the warrant. 
5) Company X and Operator Y along with their respective Cloud service data centres are all within LEA P's 
legal jurisdiction. 
d) Actions 
1) Joe invokes the dashboard program on his smartphone while connected to Operator Y's network. 
2) The dashboard program logs into both Operator Y and Company X using Joe's identity and credentials 
stored on the smartphone for each. 
3) Joe accesses a contact group of Company X co-workers from Company X directory services that are 
cooperating on embezzling money from Company X. 
4) Joe sends an email to the entire group indicating the invoice number and vendor that is faked using 
Operator Y's email service. 
5) Joe initiates an IM session with one co-worker in particular using Company X's IM service. 

6) Joe passes along bank and account information where to deposit the payment for the faked invoice. 

7) Joe logs off of the dashboard which logs off from the various services. 

8) Joe turns off his smartphone. 
e) Interaction with other services 
1) No interaction with other services is significant in this use case. 
f) Roaming 
1) Roaming does not introduce any roaming specific is
sues that are not already present in roaming 
scenarios. 
g) Post Conditions 
1) If the LEA has a data intercept, it will obtain 
any of the application speci
fic protocol between the 
dashboard application and Company X and Operator Y virtual servers. 
2) If the LEA has an application intercept on Operator Y email service, it will only obtain the email 
generated by Joe, not the directory and IM service interaction with Company X services. 
h) Challenges for interception 
1) It is not clear how LEA P will be able to parse or reverse engineer the client server protocols used 
between the dashboard and both Company X and Operator Y virtual servers in order to obtain details of 
the criminal activities. 
2) Application intercepts are not currently defined and both the legal challenges and technical challenges 
such as normalizing any LI architecture and applicatio
n protocol plus trying to maintain the normalized 
protocol in the presence of frequent application changes is significant.

b) Actors 
1) Joe is the user who has subscribed to Operator O for wireless service and their VDI service. 
2) Operator O is a wireless operator offering VDI se
rvices hosted in an internal Cloud environment. 
c) Preconditions 
1) Joe is using a PC where the local 
VDI components are already installed. 
2) The VDI service supports local and offline operation by caching at the local machine a virtual machine 
environment, a virtual machine image, Joe's application in a separate cached image and Joe's user data 
and settings in a separate cached image. 
3) The VDI service periodically (according to Oper
ator O's policies) synchronizes the VM image, 
application image and user data and setting image as changes are identified. 
4) LEA P has obtained a warrant to intercept Joe's 
communication through Operat
or O, delivered it to 
Operator O and Operator O has activated the warrant. 
5) Operator O along with its Cloud service data centre is within LEA P's legal jurisdiction. 
d) Actions 
1) Joe logs into his PC and invokes the VDI service which logs into Operator O's VDI Cloud server.

application image and user data and setting image up to date. 
3) Joe shuts off his wireless connection to Operator O's network. 

4) Joe spends 6 hours developing plans for criminal activity. 
5) Joe turns on his wireless connection to Operator O's network. 
6) The VDI Cloud service again performs a synchronization to bring the local and centralized VIM image, 
application image and user data and setting image up to
 date. In this case because the local user data has 
changed, the VDI components send the last image to the VDI Cloud server to store.

h) Challenges for Interception 
1) It is not clear how LEA P will be able to parse or reverse engineer the user data and settings image 
synchronization which could be a full image or merely a delta image. 
2) LEA P may also may not be able to parse or reverse engineer the user data in the synchronized image if it 
is in a custom format. 
3) LEA P may not have all of the applicable criminal information if the user data and setting image 
synchronization only delivers a delta image for performance reasons. 
A.9 Delayed Communication by Transferring a Cloud 
based Virtual Machine Image (VMI)  
a) Overview 
1) This use case describes a scenario where communica
tion regarding criminal activity is composed locally, 
saved in a VMI. The VMI is transferred to a Cloud environment and the communication is delivered 
from a VM in the Cloud data centre at a later time. 
b) Actors 
1) Joe is the user who has subscribed to Operator O for wireless service and their IAAS service. 
2) Operator O is a wireless operator offering IAAS services hosted in an internal Cloud environment as part

3) Joe composes an email on his email client about when the video will be streamed and the intended 
location for the IED along with the email addresses of his criminal cell. The email is saved in the client's 
outbox on the RAM disk, but not delivered. 
4) Joe creates a crontab task to start in1 hour restarting the email client to send the pending email. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 53 5) Joe creates another crontab task to start in 4 hours to stream the IED making instructional video to the 
cohorts addressed in the email. 
6) Joe requests the local hypervisor to take a snapsh
ot of the VM state and save to a local disk drive. 
7) Joe initiates an FTP transfer to transfer the VMI to Operator O's Cloud service, saved as a VMI in the 
data centre. 
8) Joe starts a VM instance using the uploaded VMI. 
9) Joe logs off from Operator O's network and shuts off his PC. 
10) One hour later, at the VM instance, the email crontab entry is activated to start up the email client and 
send the composed email . 
11) Three hours later, at the VM instance, the video streaming crontab entry is activated to start up the video 
streaming client and the IED making instructional video is streamed to the intended recipients. 
12) After the video is finished, the VM instance halts. 

13) The next day Joe deletes the uploaded VMI from Operator O's Cloud service centre. 
e) Interactions with other services 
1) No interaction with other services is significant in this use case.

sues that are not already present in roaming 
scenarios. 
g) Post Conditions 
1) Operator O will deliver to LEA P the contents of th
e FTP session transferring the VMI with the criminal 
email and video to Operator O's IAAS Cloud service. 
h) Challenges for interception 
1) It is not clear how LEA P will be able to parse or reverse engineer the VMI to locate the embedded 
criminal communication. It requires the ability to identify the RAM disk and the content structure, 
application specific file information as well as knowing
 the need to analyse the crontab tasks. Note that 
the active threads will not give any indication of 
what applications are involved in the criminal 
communication.  
2) It is not clear how LEA P would specify LI on any communication to and from any VM running under 
the LI target's subscription. 
3) It is not clear how LEA P would specify LI on any communication to and from any VM running a VMI 
created by the LI target, but activated by a 
different Operator O Cloud service subscriber.

2) The MNO only allows access to File Sharing services. 
a. The service and facilities supporting the service are located external to the MNO domain. 
b) Actors 
1) John is a user. 
2) Regional Mobile is a MNO that only allows mobile service in the Domain of 3pp-istan. 

3) AlsoRan is a vendor of 3GPP infrastructure. 
4) Mega Cloud is a Global Cloud infrastructure provider. 
5) Third Party Application provider "File Drop" is not related to any of the actors, it may have a 
relationship with Mega Cloud or an agent of Mega Cloud to host its Application. 
c) Preconditions 
1) John lives in 3pp-istan and is a subscriber of Regional Mobile. 
2) John has selected the File Sharing service from a th
ird party File Drop. The service allows John to share 
files only between users and devices that have a subscription on third party. The service provides 
encrypted services and access to other networks users including the Public. The service is limited to 

2 Gigabytes of storage. The use of the feature to move or retrieve files to or from the Cloud does 

consume access service plan with Regional Mobile. John can subscribe to larger storage plans. 
3) The Third party application does not manage access to 
shared files. Its client software provides a link 
address where the file is stored. Anyone with the link can access the file. Access to the File share system 

is via simple user name and password and can be stored in the client. 
4) The File Sharing Application is from a third party that is using resources on Mega Cloud. Those 
resources may have been contracted directly or 
through other agents and or application providers. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016

1) John selects the application from his device. And enters user name and password, if not previously saved. 
2) The application displays a directory system of his file share system, showing Private and public 
directories and the files in each. 
3) John transfers from his device memory a file to the client application. 

4) John selects to move the file to the Private folder, the client application, uploads to File Drop a copy of 
the file  
5) John selects another file, one with which he intends to commit an unlawful act and moves it to the Public 
folder. 
6) The client uploads to File Drop a copy of the file and a file locator is returned. 

7) John copies the file locator information and sends 
an SMS to an associate including the file locator 
information. 
8) The associate upon receipt of the SMS, copies the f
ile locator to his client application and retrieves the 
file. 
9) John selects a different device that has the file share application enabled. 

10) John logs into the File share systems with this de
vice and the application determines that this devices 
needs to sync with the system and down loads one file
 to the local private director (mirror on the device) 
and one to the Public folder. 
11) Sometime later John deletes the file from his shared folder (public). 

12) Sometime later John will notice that all devices that are logged in to the File Share application will have 
this file removed from its local device memory. 
13) A device that is not connected to the internet and not able to connect to the application will still retain a 
copy of the file until it is synchronized with the server. 
Variation A 
1 to 7 the same. 
8) The associated upon receipt of the SMS, forwards
 it to another associated who then copies the file 
locator to his client application and retrieves the file. 
9) Sometime later John deletes the file from his shared folder. 
Variation B 
1 to 5 the same. 
6) The client request John to enter in SMS and or ema
il address of individuals to share the content. This 
information is received by File Drop Server which then sends a unique message to each recipient. 
7) The associate upon receipt of the SMS or email,
 copies the message to his client application. 
8) The File Drop server checks the unique message against (non exhaustive list, sms MSIDN, email 
address, log in credentials of the file share and) othe
r server information to determine validly of the user 
accessing the file. 
9) Upon successful validation delivers a copy of the file. 
Variations to B 
1) File Drop server provides an indication when someone has accessed the shared files. 
2) John deletes the files from his shared folder. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 56 e) Interaction with other services 
1) The file Share may be part of an interactive service like social media, email, where updates are sent.  
2) It may be possible to access the files from social media sites. 

3) It may be possible to delete files via Email commands sent to the server. 

4) Local break with Femto cell and access to local shares and or use of Cellular Hub (cellular modem that 
terminates in wifi or Ethernet access) on John's personal network is for further study. 
f) Roaming 
1) When John roams to other networks, his File share travels with him and is accessible. Roaming Rates for 
data services may apply. 
2) Local Break out services in the visited network does not support access to the file share that is in 
Regional Mobile.  
g) Results 
1) John and his associates have shared a file that has or will be used in an unlawful act. 

2) John and the associates may have tried to hide any transactions. 

3) Regional Mobile can only provide the basic IRI of the data session and the encrypted file content to 
LEA. 
h) Challenges for interception 
1) Generally in this use case if a Warrant is effect at the time that John uploads the file, LEA will get basic 
IRI on the data session and encrypt content of the session with File Drop service. It will capture the SMS 
sent by John. 
2) It is not clear if LEA will receive information on others accessing the File share during the warrant 
period.

1) The MNO only allows access to File Sharing services only to subscribers of the service while on the 
MNO facilities and not accessible from Non 3GPP access networks: 
a. The service and facilities supporting the service are located within the MNO domain. 

b. The Facilities are external to the MNO domain but only accessible via the MNO domain. 

c. The service can be offered with or without IMS services. 
b) Actors 
1) The user is John. 

2) Scott is a user and an associate of John. 

3) Joan is a user and an associate of John. 

4) Regional Mobile is a MNO that only allows mobile service in the Domain of 3pp-istan. 
5) McCloud is a Cloud Service Provider in the Domain of Inter-istan. 
6) Thunder-Cloud is a vendor or Cloud computing infrastructure in the Domain of Inter-istan. 
c) Preconditions 
1) John lives in 3pp-istan and is a subscriber Regional Mobile and has selected the File Sharing service. The 
service allows John to share files only between users and devices that have a subscription on Regional 
Mobile. The service does not provide encrypted services and no access other networks including the 
Public. The service is limited to 2 Gigabytes of storage. The use of the feature to move or retrieve files to 
or from the Cloud does not consume any access service plan. John can subscribe to larger storage plans. 
2) Regional Mobile has contracted with McCloud to provide the service. McCloud provides a client that can 
operate on Mobile devices (smart phones, tablets and laptops). 
3) McCloud does not manage access to shared files. It
s client software provides a link address where the 
file is stored. Anyone with the link can access the file. Access to the File share system is via simple user 
name and password and can be stored in the client. 
4) McCloud contracts with Thunder-Cloud to provide infrastructure to hosts it service. 
5) Regional Mobile redirects all requests to these Fi
le Share services to McCloud using its internal DNS 
server within Regional Mobile.  
6) McCloud maintains a data base to map IP address to determine the MNO and Users. 

7) McCloud and or Thunder-Cloud may protect the User data. 
d) Actions 
1) The Regional Mobile surveillance facilities identi
fy that a target of LI has initiated communication 
covered by the LI authorization and begins delivery of the communication to the LEA. 
2) The 3gpp-istan Police Department 
begins receiving John's intercep
ted communications (i.e. IRI and CC 
for all required services as identified in the lawful
 authorization). The IRI and CC for the Consumer File 
Sharing service is delivered separately and the CC is the media that is sent to/from John (the Subject). 
3) John selects the application from his device. And enters user name and password, if not previously saved, 
it connects to the McCloud Server. 
4) The McCloud Application server provides temporary IP addresses for the Thunder Cloud infrastructure 
that is hosting the file service at that instance. 
5) The application connects to the Thundercloud infrastructure and McCloud application r
unning there. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 61 6) The application displays a directory system of his file share system, showing Private and public 
directories and the files in each. 
7) John transfers from his device memory a file to the client application. 
8) John selects to move the file to the Private folder, 
the client application, uploads to McCloud application 
a copy of the file. 
9) John selects another file, one with which he intends to commit an unlawful act and moves it to the Public 
folder. 
10) The client uploads a copy of the file and a file locator is returned. 

11) John copies the file locator information and sends 
an SMS to an associate including the file locator 
information. 
12) The associate Scott (who also is a subscriber of 
Regional Mobile) upon receipt of the SMS, copies the 
file locator to his client application and retrieves the file. 
13) John selects a different device that has the file share application enabled. 

14) John logs into the File share systems with this de
vice and the application determines that this devices 
needs to sync with the system and down loads one file
 to the local private director (mirror on the device) 
and one to the Public folder. 
15) Sometime later John deletes the file from his shared folder (public). 
16) Sometime later John will notice that all devices that are logged in to the File Share application will have 
this file removed from its local device memory. 
17) A device that is not connected to the MNO network and not able to connect to the application will still 
retain a copy of the file until it is synchronized with the server. 
Variations A 
1 to 11 the same. 
12) The associated Scott (who also is a subscriber of 
Regional Mobile) upon receipt of the SMS, forwards it 
to another associate Joan who then copies the file lo
cator to her client application and retrieves the file. 
13) Sometime later John deletes the file from his shared folder. 
Variations B 
1 to 10 the same. 
11) The client request John to enter in SMS and or ema
il address of individuals to share the content. This 
information is received by McCloud Server which 
then sends a unique messages to each recipient. 
12) The associate Scott (who also is a subscriber of 
Regional Mobile) upon receipt of the SMS or email, 
copies the message to his client application. 
13) The McCloud application checks the unique message against (non-exhaustive list, sms MSIDN, email 
address, log in credentials of the file share and) othe
r server information to determine validly of the user 
accessing the file. 
14) Upon successful validation delivers a copy of the file. 
Variations to B 
1) McCloud server provides an indication when someone has accessed the shared files. 
2) John deletes the files from his shared folder.  
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 62 e) Interaction with other services 
1) The file Share may be part of an interactive Messaging platform, where all files are stored, voice mail, 
video mail and shared files. 
2) It may be possible to access the shared fold
er via tele-prompts in the Messaging centre. 
3) It may be possible to access the system via We
b Browser client through the MNO's Web Portal. 
4) It may be possible to delete files via Email commands sent to the server. 
5) Local break with Femto cell and access to local shares and or use of Cellular Hub (cellular modem that 
terminates in Wi-Fi or Ethernet access) on John's personal network is for further study. 
f) Roaming 
1) When John roams to other networks, his File share travels with him and is accessible. Roaming Rates for 
data services may apply. 
2) John could send a SMS or email to others with a file location to people not subscribers to Regional 
Mobile, however they would receive an error messages. 
3) Local Break out services in the visited network does not support access to the file share that is in 
Regional Mobile. 
g) Post Conditions 
1) John and his associates Scott and Joan have shared a file that has or will be used in an unlawful act. 

2) John and the associates Scott and Joan may have tried to hide any transactions.

ated logs (business records, Data Storage).  
7) The files are accessible to LEA in Inter-istan, although it is unclear on the relationship to John and the 
file server User ID used, Regional Mobile may only have this information. 
8) Issue of file de-publication (i.e. pointers to one storage of a file).

service is limited to 2 Gigabytes of storage. The use of the feature to move or retrieve files to or from the 
Cloud does not consume any access service plan. Mary can subscribe to larger storage plans. 
2) Mobile Anywhere has contracted with McCloud to provide the service (File Sharing). Mobile Anywhere 
uses a Cloud Services Application from its Infrastructure Vendor AlsoRan. The Cloud Service 
Application can support many Cloud Services and prov
ides Mobile Anywhere with integration interface 
to these services and the vendors that may be used to provide service. 
3) AlsoRan provides a client that can operate on devices (smart phones, tablets and laptops) and the NNI, 
(Network to Network Interface) with McCloud. AlsoRan may hide the user's identity from McCloud. 
4) McCloud does not manage access to shared files. Its client software provides a link address where the 
file is stored. Anyone with the link can access the file. Access to the File share system is via simple user 

name and password and can be stored in the client. 
5) McCloud contracts with Thunder-Cloud to provide infrastructure to hosts it service. Thunder-Cloud and 
McCloud reside in Inter-istan.  
6) Mobile Anywhere utilizes an FQDN to address the Cloud Service and redirects all requests to these File 
Share services to AlsoRAN Cloud Service Application Server using its internal DNS server within 

Mobile Anywhere. External requests are directed to the appropriate Firewalls in Mobile Anywhere and to 

the Cloud Service Application Server.  
7) The Cloud Service Application requires User lo
gon in order to access the File Share application. 
8) The Cloud Service Application may locally manage th
e subscriber information an store all users files as 
unique files as Mobile Anywhere files, hiding all users from McCloud. 
9) Through the NII, several parameters may be utilized in Mobile Anywhere's deployment. 
a. Time to Live parameters, upon access of file 
b. Logon

and its Users. It may provide back up and restoration features. 
11) McCloud and or Thunder-Cloud may protect the MNO and or User data. 
12) AlsoRan may encrypt the files it stores with McCloud. These may be one key for all files or individual 
keys for each subscriber. Mobile Anywhere through 
AlsoRan manages these keys and are not provided 
to the subscriber. 
d) Actions 
1) The Mobile Anywhere surveillance facilities identify that a target of LI has initiated communication 
covered by the LI authorization and begins delivery of the communication to the LEA.

-01) 72 2) The 3gpp-istan Police Department 
begins receiving Mary's intercepted communications (i.e. IRI and CC 
for all required services as identified in the lawful
 authorization). The IRI and CC for the Consumer File 
Sharing service is delivered separately and the CC is the media that is sent to/from Mary (the Subject). 
3) Mary selects the application from her device (Mobile). And enters user name and password, if not 
previously saved, it connects to the AlsoRan Cloud A
pplication Server.  Auto login maybe enabled if the 
device is connected directly Mobile Anywhere facilities, Mobile and or Broadband, using other proxies 
(e.g. Single Sign On, Generic User profile (GUP), IMSI without a password). 
4) The AlsoRan Cloud Application Server accesse
s it database and service profile for Mary. 
5) The application displays a directory system of her file share system, showing Private and public 
directories and the files in each. 
6) Mary transfers from her device memory a file to the client application. 
7) Mary selects to move the file to the Private fold
er, the client application, communicates with AlsoRan 
Cloud Application Server to store a copy of the file. 
8) AlsoRan Cloud Application Server communicates with McCloud that it is about to send a file for 
storage. 
9) As the file is received by AlsoRan Cloud Application Server it is encrypted and sent to McCloud using 
information it received from McCloud on parameters an
d location of the infrastructure required to store 
the file. 
10) On completions of the storage, Thunder-Cloud and McCloud provide a signal to AlsoRan Cloud 
Application Server that the file has been stored 
successfully and an indication is provided to Mary. 
11) AlsoRan Cloud Application Server updates its database on the files it holds for Mary and their 
corresponding file descriptors in McCloud. 
12) Mary selects another file, one with which she intends to commit an unlawful act and moves it to the 
Public folder. 
13) The client uploads a copy of the file as described in steps 8 to 11. 
14) AlsoRan Cloud Application Server then provides Mary with an FQDN to share the file with others. 

15) Mary copies the file locator information and sends an SMS to an associate including the file locator 
information. 
16) The associate Brad (who also is a subscriber of 
Mobile Anywhere) upon receipt of the SMS, copies the 
file locator to his client application, The AlsoRan Cloud Application Server forces Brad to log in. Once 
logged the Application Server request a file from McCloud that corresponds to the FQDN, decrypts it 

and sends it to Brad's client. 
17) Mary selects a different device that has the file share application enabled. 
18) Mary logs into the AlsoRan Cloud Application Server. The server determines that Mary is using a 
different device, 
19) The AlsoRan Cloud Application Server accesses it data
base and service profile for Mary and determines 
that the File share Cloud service needs to sync with the service and from the data base, requests files to 
be down loaded from McCloud, decrypted and down load
s one file to the local private director (mirror 
on the device) and one to the Public folder. 
20) Sometime later Mary deletes the file from her shared folder (public). 
21) Sometime later Mary will notice that all devices that are logged in to the File Share application will have 
their file removed from its local device memory. 
22) A device that is not connected to the AlsoRan Clou
d Application Server and not able to connect to the 
application will still retain a copy of the file until it is synchronized with the server.

16) The associate Brad (who also is a subscriber of Regi
onal Mobile) upon receipt of the SMS, forwards it to 
another associate Gabor (who is not a subscriber of the Cloud Services). 
17) Gabor connects to the internet and connects to the AlsoRan Cloud Application Server using the FQDN 
that identifies the file. The AlsoRan Cloud Applicat
ion Server forces Gabor to log in. Login fails and 
Gabor is denied access to the file. 
18) Sometime later Mary deletes the file from her shared folder. 
Variation C 
1 to 14 the same. 
15) The client request Mary to enter in SMS and or email address of individuals to share the content. Their 
information is received by AlsoRan Cloud Applicatio
n Server which then sends a unique messages to 
each recipient. 
16) The associate Gabor upon receipt of the SMS or email, copies the message. 
17) Gabor connects to the internet and connects to the AlsoRan Cloud Application Server using the FQDN 
that identifies the file. 
18) AlsoRan Cloud Application Server checks the unique message against (non-exhaustive list, sms MSIDN, 
email address, log in credentials of the file share and)
 other server information to determine validly of the 
user accessing the file. 
19) Upon successful validation delivers a copy of the decrypted file. 
Variations to B and C 
1) AlsoRan Cloud Application Server provides an indication when some has accessed the shared files. 
2) Mary deletes the files from her shared folder.  
e) Interaction with other services 
1) The file Share may be part of an interactive Messaging platform, where all files are stored, voice mail, 
video mail and shared files. 
2) It may be possible to access the shared fold
er via tele-prompts in the Messaging centre. 
3) It may be possible to access the system via We
b Browser client through the MNO's Web Portal. 

4) It may be possible to delete files via Email commands sent to the server. 

5) Local break with Femto cell and access to local shares and or use of Cellular Hub (cellular modem that 
terminates in wifi or Ethernet access) on Ma

IRI and CC of Mary's communications. Using that 
information in their investigations, 
they prevent a crime from occurring. 
4) Mobile Anywhere met their regulatory obligation to unobtrusively deliver communication to the 
authorized LEA.  
h) Challenges for interception 
1) Generally in the use case if a Warrant is effect at the time that Mary uploads the file, LEA should receive 
all related information. 
2) It is not clear how attempts to access the file are communicated to LEA (FQDN access without login).  
3) For specific implementations it is not clear if other means to delete the file can be captured. 

4) It is not clear if Legal instruments are used in Inter-istan on McCloud, if they can stop access to specific 
files in 3gpp-istan (in this use case Mobile Anywhere has encrypted the data, thus obscuring the identity 
and the content of the files to determine any file to
 any user, however a court order could block access to 
all files (more a data retention issue, as real time delivery would be captured until the court order). 
5) It is not clear how LEA will access the files in McCloud and or Thunder Cloud systems to preserve the 
contents of the file and its associated 
logs (business records, Data Storage). 
6) How and what data/ IRI is presented to LEA (e.g. service type, clear text files, message deletions, 
message delivery (email)). 
7) Various user identities used to access the files, IMSI, user name. 
8) For specific implementations it is not clear how the Cloud Service "File share or Drop box" is 
communicated to LEA to identify the type

uses Hyper-Cloud infrastructure. Each MNO may tweak the service it provides, but a Jungle Cloud client 
is provided to each user that is labelled with the MNO offering. The Cloud service requires Login and 

passwords that are stored in Jungle Cloud. The serv
ice provides private directories for users, shared 
directories and public directories. Access to each is 
controlled by permissions allocated by the IT group 
of the SMB.  
3) The service allows all to access files only between users and devices that have a subscription on Jungle 
Cloud and a member of the folders. A subscription is available to web access only subscribers not having 

any other services. The service does not provide encrypted files services. But it uses SSL on web access 

and VPN tunnels to the MNO's infrastructure. 
 Assumed that the MNO know their legal obligation for access and have requested VPN so that the files 
are in the clear when delivered over their networks, which are encrypted from others and encrypted over 

public access facilities. 
4) A support function is provided by the MNO's via Jungle Cloud to add/modify/delete users from the file 
share and to added other directories and permission
s. A separate archival service is available. 
5) Jungle Cloud provides a client to the MNO that can be White labelled that can operate on devices (smart 
phones, tablets and laptops).  
6) Jungle Cloud manages access to shared files. Its client software provides a link address where the file is 
stored. Anyone with the link can access the file if they have logged in and have permission for that 

directory. Access to the File share system is via simple user name and password and can be stored in the 

client. 
7) Jungle Cloud contracts with Hyper-Cloud to provide infrastructure to hosts it service. 
8) Jungle Cloud or Hyper-Cloud may have Dynamic triggering capabilities.  
9) The Jungle Cloud Client utilizes an FQDN to address the Cloud Service. All requests in the MNO are 
directed to the VPN to Jungle Cloud Service. External requests are directed via DNS directly to Jungle 
Cloud. 
10) The Cloud Service Application requires User lo
gon in order to access the File Share application. 
11) The Cloud Service Application may locally manage th
e subscriber information and store all users' files 
as unique files associated with the users or as SMB f
iles. It may encrypt that files that are stored on the 
Cloud to protect access from others, but delivers the files in clear text which is then encrypted for the 

access (VPN or SSL).  
12) Through agreements, several parameters may be utilized in deployment. 
a. Time to Live parameters, upon access of file 
b. Logon

-01) 82 d) Actions 
1) John is the target of a legal warrant. 
2) Regional Mobile surveillance facilities identify that a target of LI has initiated communication covered 
by the LI authorization and begins delivery of the communication to the LEA. 
3) The 3gpp-istan Police Department 
begins receiving John's intercep
ted communications (i.e. IRI and CC 
for all required services as identified in the lawf
ul authorization). The IRI and CC for the File Sharing 
service is delivered separately and the CC is the media that is sent to/from John (the Subject). 
4) John selects the application from his device (Mobile). And enters user name and password, if not 
previously saved, it connects to the Jungle Cloud -C
loud Application Server.  Auto login maybe enabled 
if the device is connected directly Regional Mobile facilities, using other proxies (e.g. Single Sign On, 
Generic User profile (GUP), IMSI without a password). 
5) The Jungle Cloud accesses it database and serv
ice profile for John and the associated SMB. 
6) Jungle Cloud responds with an FQDN that will provide the users file structure. 
7) The application displays a directory system of hi
s directories that he has access, showing his Private, 
SMB shared and public directories and the files in each. 
8) John transfers from his device memory a file to the client application. 

9) John selects to move the file to the SMB Shared fo
lder, the client application, communicates with Jungle 
Cloud Server to store a copy of the file. 
10) Jungle Cloud provides a link address.  

11) On completions of the storage, Jungle-Cloud provide an indication is provided to John. 

12) During this time IRI is generated, CC is generated. 

13) John selects another file, one with which he intends to commit an unlawful act and moves it to the Public 
folder. 
14) The client uploads a copy of the file as described in steps 8 to 12. 

15) Jungle Cloud Server then provides John with an FQDN to share the file with others. 

16) John copies the file locator information and sends 
an SMS to an associate including the file locator 
information. IRI is generated. This could be used in Dynamic Triggering to set up other cooperating 
systems for associates. Dynamic triggers will not be effective if the user writes down the file location 

unless the triggering is based on the file itself. 
17) The associate Brad (who also is a subscriber of 
Mobile Anywhere) upon receipt of the SMS, copies the 
file locator to his client application and the client then downloads the file from Jungle Cloud. No IRI is 

generated, nor CC as Brad is not the subject of the interception. If a Warrant were placed on Mobile 

Anywhere for Brad then IRI and CC would be generate
d. If a warrant were placed at Jungle Cloud then 
IRI and CC would be generated.  Information collected from each entity may be different, Jungle Cloud 
could provide additional detail not available from Mobile Anywhere and Regional Mobile, but cannot 
provide location precision that the MNO can provide.  
18) John selects a different device that has the file share application enabled. 
19) John logs into the Jungle Cloud Server using a Hotspot connection with his laptop. The server 
determines that John is using a different device. 
20) The Jungle Cloud Se
rver accesses it database and service profile for John and determines that the File 
share Cloud service needs to sync with the service. 
Several files are downloaded to John's device. No IRI 
is generated, no CC is generated. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 83 21) Sometime later John deletes the file from the Public folder. John's client will send the delete command to 
Jungle Cloud Server. No IRI is generated.  The file may be retained for legal, financial, archival 
(Business Continuity), restoral purposes as determined by the SMB Service Contracts, MNO needs or by 

Jungle Cloud). 
22) Sometime later John will notice that all devices that are logged in to the File Share application will have 
their file removed from its local device memory. (Client messages not described) IRI is generated only 
when John Mobile device is active. The deleted files may be accessible by file recovery programs. 
23) A device that is not connected to the Jungle Cloud Server and not able to connect to the application will 
still retain a copy of the file until it is synchronized with the server. 
Variation A 
1 to 16 the same. 
17) The associate Brad (who also is a subscriber of Mobile Anywhere) upon receipt of the SMS, forwards it 
to another associate Joan. 
18) Joan connects to the internet and connects to the Ju
ngle Cloud Server using the FQDN that identifies the 
file. The Jungle Cloud Server delivers the file from the Public folder. No IRI is generated, no CC is 
generated. 
19) Sometime later John deletes the file from the Public folder. 
Variations to A 
1) Jungle Cloud Server provides an indication when some has accessed the Public Folder to the SMB. 
2) Someone else in the SMB deletes the files from the Public folder.  
e) Interaction with other services 
1) The file Share may be part of an interactive Messaging platform, where all files are stored, voice mail, 
video mail and shared files. 
2) It may be possible to access the shared fold
er via tele-prompts in the Messaging centre. 
3) It is possible to access the system via Web Browser client through the MNO's Web Portal. 

4) It may be possible to delete files via Email commands sent to the server. 

5) Local break with Femto cell and access to local shares and or use of Cellular Hub (cellular modem that 
terminates in Wi-Fi or Ethernet access) on John's personal network is for further study. 
f) Roaming 
1) When John roams to other networks, his File share travels with him and is accessible. Roaming Rates for 
data services may apply. 
2) John can access the file share from local hotspots. 

3) John could send a SMS or email to others with a file location to people not subscribers to Mobile 
Anywhere Cloud Service.  
4) Local Break out services in the visited network is for further study. 
g) Post Conditions 
1) John and her associates Brad and Joan have shared a file that has or will be used in an unlawful act. 

2) John and the associates Brad and Joan may have tried to hide any transactions. 

3) The 3gpp-istan Police Department received the IRI and some CC of John's communications via Regional 
Mobile when John was using his mobile device. The communication on other service (Hotspot or 
Broadband) were not captured and other means will be required to capture that content and IRI. Using 
that information in their investigations, they may be able to prevent a crime from occurring. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 84 4) Regional Mobile has met their regulatory obligation to unobtrusively deliver communication to the 
authorized LEA.  
h) Challenges for interception 
1) Generally in the use case if a Warrant is effect at the time that John uploads the file, LEA should receive 
all related IRI information from that Service provider. 
2) It is clear that other warrants are required to capt
ure other events while at a hotspot or on a broadband 
connection.  
3) For specific implementations it is not clear if other means to delete the file can be captured. 
4) It is not clear what interface will be used by Jungle
 Cloud if they were served a Warrant. Some aspect of 
messaging, data retention and data in motion exist. 
5) It is not clear how LEA will access the files in Jungle Cloud systems to preserve the contents of the file 
and its associated logs (busin
ess records, Data Storage).  
6) How and what data/ IRI is presented to LEA (e.g. service type, clear text files, message deletions, 
message delivery (email)). 
7) Various user identities used to access the files, IMSI, user name, HTTP identity. 

8) For specific implementations it is not clear how the Cloud Service "Private, Shared, Public" is 
communicated to LEA to identify the ty
pe of service the IRI and CC belong. 
9) There may be multiple device attached and connected at the same time with the same or different identity 
(several web client, several mobile devices, PSTN connection via voice navigation, SMTP (email 
client)).   If captured at Jungle Cloud, if several 
devices are logged in and the user up loads a file, all 
devices will by synced cause duplication of all the CC. 
10) It is unclear what would be captured on the NNI interfaces, i.e. if permissions for John were changed. 
A.18 Consumer based File Sharing 8 
 Figure A-9 
a) Overview 
1) The SMB and or Enterprise require two or more MNOs to provide its Cloud service for file sharing for 
their employees. The MNO have white labelled a service from the same Cloud provider. 
a. The service can be offered with or without IMS services. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 85 b) Actors 
1) The user is John.  
2) Joan is a user and an associate of John. 

3) Brad is a user and an associate of John. 

4) Mobile Anywhere is an MNO that provides access se
rvices on Mobile, fixed and broadband networks in 
the Domain of 3pp-istan. 
5) Regional Mobile is a MNO that only allows mobile service in the Domain of 3gpp-istan. 

6) Jungle Cloud is a Cloud Service Provider in the Domain of 3gpp-istan. 

7) Hyper-Cloud is a vendor or Cloud computing infrastructure in the Domain of 3gpp-istan. 
c) Preconditions 
1) John, Joan and Brad live in 3pp-istan and work for a Small national Business company that have farmed 
out their IT infrastructure and use a Bring your own Device (BYOD) model for their employees, which 
includes laptops, PC and wireless devices for access to the company files, email and subscriber 

databases. The SMB has chosen to place all it files and databases on Cloud infrastructure and has 

negotiated with the MNO in 3gpp-istan to provide 
access for their employees using their mobile, wifi 
and broadband connections. 
2) Regional Mobile and Mobile Anywhere have white labelled a service from Jungle Cloud which in turn 
uses Hyper-Cloud infrastructure. Each MNO provides an AlsoRan Proxy Cloud Server in their networks 

to interface to Jungle Cloud. Each MNO may tweak the service it provides, but an AlsoRan client is 

provided to each user that is labelled with the MNO 
offering. The service provides private directories for 

users, shared directories and public directories. A
ccess to each is controlled by permissions allocated by 
the IT group of the SMB.  
3) AlsoRan provides a client that can operate on devices (smart phones, tablets and laptops) and the NNI, 
(Network to Network Interface) with Jungle Cloud. AlsoRan may hide the user's identity from Jungle 

Cloud. 
4) Jungle Cloud does not manage access to shared files. 
Its client software provides a link address where the 
file is stored. Anyone with the link can access the file. Access to the File share system is via simple user 

name and password and can be stored in the client. 
5) The service allows all to access files only between users and devices that have a subscription with the 
MNO and are members of the folders. A subscriptio
n is available to web access only subscribers not 
having any other services. The service does not provide encrypted files services. But it uses SSL on web 

access and VPN tunnels to the MNO's infrastructure. 
 Assumed that the MNO know their legal obligation for access and have requested VPN so that the files 
are in the clear when delivered over their networks, which are encrypted from others and encrypted over 
public access facilities. 
6) A support function is provided by the MNO's via Jungle Cloud to add/ modify / delete users from the file 
share and to added other directories and permission
s. A separate archival service is available. 
7) Jungle Cloud contracts with Hyper-Cloud to provide infrastructure to hosts it service. 
8) Jungle Cloud or Hyper-Cloud may have Dynamic triggering capabilities.  

9) The AlsoRan Client utilizes an FQDN to address the Cloud Service. All requests in the MNO are 
directed to the VPN to Jungle Cloud Service via the Proxy Cloud Sever. External requests are directed 
via DNS to the appropriate MNO that supports the us
er access to Public folders, from Broadband, these 

can split between the MNOs or directed to Jungle Cloud and it makes a decision on routing of addresses 

via the MNO or it is not addressed by the MNO. 
10) The Cloud Service Application requires User lo
gon in order to access the File Share application.

14) Jungle Cloud may maintain a data base of MNO and or of MNO and its Users. It may provide back up 
and restoration features. 
15) Jungle Cloud and or Hyper-Cloud may protect the MNO and or User data. 

16) AlsoRan may encrypt the files it stores with Jungle Cloud. These may be one key for all files or 
individual keys for each subscriber. Mobile anywhere and Regional Mobile may use a common 
encryption service (Media Security)) to manages thes
e keys and are not provided to the subscriber. 
17) The SMB may encrypt the files it stores with the MNO. These may be one key for all files or individual 
keys for each subscriber using open PGP software.

associated SMB.  
6) The application displays a directory system of hi
s file share system, Personal, SMB Private and public 
directories and the files in each that John has access.  
7) John transfers from his device memory a file to the client application. 
8) John selects to move the file to the SMB Private folder, the client application, communicates with 
AlsoRan Cloud Application Server to store a copy of the file. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 87 9) AlsoRan Cloud Application Server communicates with Jungle Cloud that it is about to send a file for 
storage. 
10) The AlsoRan Cloud server in Regional Mobile communicates with a key server to retrieve the common 
key used by the SMB. 
11) As the file is received by AlsoRan Cloud Application Server it is encrypted and sent to Jungle Cloud 
using information it received from Jungle Cloud on para
meters and location of the infrastructure required 
to store the file. 
12) On completions of the storage, Hyper-Cloud and Jungle Cloud provide a signal to AlsoRan Cloud 
Application Server that the file has been stored 
successfully and an indication is provided to John. 
13) AlsoRan Cloud Application Server updates its database on the files it holds for John and their 
corresponding file descriptors in Jungle Cloud. 
14) During this time IRI is generated, CC is generated. 
15) John selects another file, one with which he intends to commit an unlawful act and moves it to the Public 
folder. 
16) The client uploads a copy of the file as described in steps 8 to 14. 

17) AlsoRan Server then provides John with an FQDN to share the file with others. 

18) John copies the file locator information and sends 
an SMS to an associate including the file locator 
information. IRI is generated.  This could be used in Dynamic Triggering to set up other cooperating 
systems. Dynamic triggers will not be effective if the user writes down the file location unless the 

triggering is based on the file itself. 
19) The associate Brad (who also is a subscriber of M
obile Anywhere ) upon receipt of the SMS, copies the 
file locator to his client application, the file is located in the Regional Mobile and that AlsoRan Cloud 

Application Server forces Brad to 
log in. Once logged the Application Server request a file from Jungle 
Cloud that corresponds to the FQDN, a key for the SMB from a key server and then decrypts it and sends 

it to Brad's client. It may be possible that the URI us
ed in the SMS, email can be parsed by a client to a 
different network, i.e. Brad client could have replaced the Regional Mobile 

(www.regionalmobile.3gppistan/Cloud/smb/index=? 12345678qwededed) with corresponding Mobile 

Anywhere prefixes to address the same file location that would be in Jungle Cloud. In this case LI 

information may not be captured unless other proce
sses occur. The MNO could map APN information to 
provide a similar function and VPN tunnel between 
MNO for the Cloud sharing service resolving the 
DNS query to Regional Mobile, thus Brad clients would access the VPN tunnel and show up in Regional 

Mobiles AlsoRan Cloud Server. User name/ Passwo
rds authentication is possible via VPN tunnels 
between the MNO and the Proxy servers. 
20) John selects a different device that has the file share application enabled. 
21) John logs into the AlsoRan Cloud Server using a Hotspot connection with his laptop. The server 
determines that John is using a different device. 
22) The AlsoRan Cloud Application Server accesses it da
tabase and service profile for John and determines 
that the Files and directories for the SMB Cloud service needs to sync with the service and from the data 
base, requests files to be down loaded from Jungle Cloud, a key for the SMB from a key server and then 

decrypts and several files are downloaded to Johns device. IRI is generated, CC is generated. 
23) Sometime later John deletes the file from the Public folder. John's client will send the delete command to 
AlsoRan Cloud Server (client messages not described to Jungle Cloud). IRI is generated.  The file may 

be retained for legal, financial, archival (Business Continuity), restoral purposes as determined by the 

SMB Service Contracts, MNO needs or by Jungle Cloud). 
24) Sometime later John will notice that all devices that are logged in to the File Share application will have 
their file removed from its local device memory. (Client messages not described) IRI is generated for all 
of John active devices.  The deleted files may be accessible by file recovery programs. 
25) A device that is not connected to the Jungle Cloud Server and not able to connect to the application will

ry and Selection Function 
(ANDSF) Use Case 
 Figure A-10: Use of ANDSF with Operator provided Cloud Services 
a) Overview 
1) The MNO only allows File sharing services that c
ontrol by a policy server (ANDSF) to subscribers on its 
and Non 3GPP access networks. 
a. The Cloud Facilities are external to the MNO domain but only accessible via the MNO. 

b. The service can be offered with or without IMS services. 
b) Actors 
1) The user is John. 

2) Mobile Anywhere is a Mobile Network Operator (MNO). 

3) McCloud is a Cloud Service Provider (CSP). 
c) Preconditions 
1) John is a subscriber to a mobile data service from Mobile Anywhere. John has a subscription to a Cloud 
service, type of DaaS - Data as a Service (e.g. data storage in the Cloud) from Mobile Anywhere. There 
is a business relationship between Mobile Anywhere and McCloud such as that McCloud provides 
'White-labelled' Cloud services to Mobile Anywhere.  
2) John carries a UE that has WLAN capabilities (i.e. 
dual mode handset, Wi-Fi + cellular) and an installed 
ANDSF client.  
3) Mobile Anywhere operates an ANDSF Server in its network. The server is under its full control and 
provides policies that could be used by the mobile device regarding: 
a. Access network discovery 

b. ISMP (Inter System Mobility Policy) 

c. ISRP (Inter System Routing Policy) 
  ETSI ETSI TR 101 567 V1.1.1 (2016
-01) 91 4) Mobile Anywhere can provision John's UE with its policies by using the ANDSF mechanism. 
5) John's UE has an ANDSF client that can connect securely with the ANDSF server to get periodical 
updates, which may change based on John's location, time of day or other attributes. 
6) Mobile Anywhere can configure a list of its managed services and their associated routing policies, e.g.: 
a. Cloud Services -- traffic is routed through core network 

b. VoIP - traffic is routed through core network 
c. Other services (e.g. web browsing) -- may not be routed through core network 
7) UE is configured with enhanced operator's policies to enable rules to route traffic for different 
applications between the Wi-Fi and cellular networks in general and may invoke policies in case of 
Lawful Intercept. 
d) Actions 
1) The Mobile Anywhere surveillance facilities identify that a target of LI has initiated communication 
covered by the LI authorization and begins delivery of the communication to the LEA. 
2) The 3gpp-istan Police Department 
begins receiving John's intercep
ted communications (i.e. IRI and CC 
for all required services as identified in the lawf
ul authorization). The IRI and CC for the File Sharing 
service is delivered separately and the CC is the media that is sent to/from John's (the Subject). 
3) John connects his UE to an available Wi-Fi network.  
4) John, as a subscriber of Cloud service, decide
s to retrieve a file from his Cloud service account. 
5) Based on the Mobile Anywhere's policies provisioned in the UE, John's traffic leaving Wi-Fi network is 
routed through operator's core network, instead of go
ing directly to the internet and access to the Cloud 
service occurs. 
6) The file requested from the Cloud service passes through Mobile Anywhere's Network and is delivered 
to John's UE. 
7) During this time IRI is generated, CC is generated. 
e) Interaction with other services
