Table 4: TaskDetails 
Field Description
 Format M/C/O
 XID 
Uniquely identifies the Task. 
 
There may be more than one different 
Task relating to the same target identifier 
(two distinct XIDs). The X1 interface 

supports delivery of this situation (i.e. it is 

not considered an error on the X1 
interface). 
UUIDv4 (see clause 5.1). 
M 
TargetIdentifiers List of criteria which are used to identify 
the traffic to be intercepted. 
 Where multiple criteria are present, all 
criteria are required to be matched. If an 

NE cannot target based on the criteria 

specified (e.g. due to an unsupported 
format or inappropriate combination of 
identifiers) the NE shall reject the 

request with an appropriate error. 

 It is an implementation decision which 
identifiers and combinations of identifiers 

are supported. 
Each TargetIdentifier given follows one of 

the formats given in table 5. 
M DeliveryType Statement of whether to deliver X2 
and/or X3. 
Enumerated value - one of "X2Only", 

"X3Only" and "X2andX3".
MListOfDIDs 
Details of where to send the intercepted 
traffic. 
 It is an implementation decision for the 

NE to determine how to duplicate traffic if 

multiple destinations are specified, or if 
multiple destinations are supported.  
List of Destination Identifiers (DID) 
referencing the desired delivery destination 
records. 
M TaskDetailsExtensions One or more extension placeholders; 
each may be populated by a list of 

elements defined by external
