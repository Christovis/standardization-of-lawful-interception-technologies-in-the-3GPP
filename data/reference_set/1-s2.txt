the

It

the

Introduction
 
Mobile
 
wireless
 
communication
 
evolved,
 
since
 
the
 
late
 
1970s,
 
from
 
analog
 
voice
 
calls
 
to
 
the
 
current
 
modern
 
technologies,
 
providing
 
end-
 
users
 
with
 
high
 
data
 
rates
 
to
 
perform
 
(multimedia)
 
data
 
and
 
communi-
 
cation
 
transmissions
 
[1]
 
.
 
The
 
spreading
 
and
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
mobile
 
wireless
 
communication
 
are
 
also
 
encouraged
 
by
 
the
 

 
of
 
mobile
 
devices
 
such
 
as
 
smart
 
phones
 
and
 
tablets,
 
which
 
pave
 
the
 
way
 
for
 
the
 
realization
 
of
 
mobile
 
applications.
 
The
 
consequence
 
is
 
a
 
huge
 
increment
 
of
 
the
 
network
 

 
which
 
naturally
 
requires
 
new
 
means
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
widespread
 
supply
 
of
 
“wireless
 
”services
 
with
 
high
 
levels
 
of
 
Quality
 
of
 
Service
 
(QoS).
 
To
 
cope
 
with
 
such
 
an
 
issue,
 
as
 
expected,
 
at
 
the
 
threshold
 
of
 
2020,
 
we
 
are
 
witnessing
 
to
 
the
 
put
 
in
 
action
 
of
 
the
 
next
 
generation
 
5G
 
wire-
 
less
 
communications
 
[2]
 
.
 
The
 
5G
 
network
 
architecture’s
 
components
 
are
 
sketched
 
in
 
Fig.

and
 
include:
 
(i)
 
a
 
huge
 
number
 
of
 
macro-cells
 
and
 
micro-cells,
 
associated
 
with
 
proper
 
base
 
stations
 
and/or
 
hotspots,
 
for
 
guaranteeing
 
the
 
pervasiveness
 
of
 
the
 
connectivity
 
among
 
end-
 
devices/end-users;
 
(ii)
 
the
 
core
 
network,
 
composed
 
by
 
routers,
 
gate-
 
ways,
 
etc.,
 
which
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
gathering
 
and
 
transmitting
 
the
 
in-
 
formation
 
acquired
 
by
 
the
 
base
 
stations;
 
(iii)
 
the
 

 
connection
 
to
 
the

which
 
may
 
take
 
place
 
through

Compared
 
to
 
the
 
actual
 
4G
 
technologies,
 
5G
 
is
 
characterized
 
by
 
higher
 
bit
 
rates,
 

 
in
 
more
 
than
 
10
 
gigabits
 
per
 
second,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
by
 
more
 
capacity
 
and
 
very
 
low
 
latency.
 
Such
 
features
 
are
 
fundamen-
 
tal
 
in
 
a
 
world
 
increasingly
 
connected,
 
especially
 
thanks
 
to
 
the
 
continu-
 
ous
 
spreading
 
of
 
billions
 
of
 
connected
 
objects
 
and
 
smart
 
devices
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
Internet
 
of
 
Things
 
(IoT).
 
In
 
fact,
 
in
 
the
 
emerging
 
IoT
 
era,
 
5G
 
certainly
 
enables
 
to
 
overcome
 
the
 
current
 
issues
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
network
 
response
 
times
 
and
 
network
 
resources’
 
management.
 
Note
 
that
 
the
 
IoT
 
paradigm
 
embraces
 
heterogeneous
 
technologies,
 
ranging
 
from
 
Wireless
 
Sensor
 
Networks
 
(WSNs),
 
to
 
RFID,
 
NFC,
 
actuators,
 
and
 
so
 
on,
 
which
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
communicate
 
through
 

 
protocols
 
and
 
standards.
 
The
 
data
 
acquired
 
by
 
such
 
kinds
 
of
 
devices
 
are
 
usually
 
collected
 
by
 
the
 
so-
 
called
 
“smart
 
objects
 
”,
 
which
 
act
 
as
 
a
 
middleware
 
(or
 
fog)
 
layer,
 
in
 
or-
 
der
 
to
 
be
 
processed
 
and
 
shared
 
with
 
the
 
end-users,
 
which
 
are
 
interested
 
in
 
certain
 
services
 
[3]
 
.
 
Hence,
 
in
 
such
 
a
 
scenario,
 
also
 
the
 
role
 
of
 
fog
 
computing
 
[4]
 
peeks
 
out.
 
Fog
 
computing,
 
which
 
is
 
also
 
known
 
as
 
fog
 
networking
 
or
 
fogging
 
,
 
mainly
 
consists
 
of
 
a
 
decentralized
 
networking
 
and
 
computing
 
infrastructure,
 
where
 
data,
 
processing
 
tasks,
 
storage
 
and
 
ap-
 
plications
 
are
 
distributed
 
in
 
an

 S. Sicari, A. Rizzardi and A. Coen-Porisini Computer Networks 179 (2020) 107345 Fig. 1. 5G network’s components. However, as such devices are connected to the network all the time in a even more pervasive way, they can be more easily tracked down and are more vulnerable towards several kinds of attacks, such as: eaves- dropping, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, Denial of-Service (DoS), replay, repudiation, and so on [5] . Maintaining a high level of QoS in terms of delay, when a huge amount of data is transferred inside the 5G network, while keeping, at the same time, the reliability of the network itself, is a critical and complex task. The  goal is to pre- vent the data violation and the improper  of malicious contents among the mobile devices. Hence, the design of new security and pri- vacy oriented solutions, targeted to the 5G network, represents now a compelling need, due to the imminent  of the 5G technology in the real world. In this paper, a broad overview of the security and privacy issues re- lated to 5G network is provided, along with the discussion about already available solutions in literature. To this end, the following requirements are investigated: data integrity,  authentication, access control, non-repudiation, trust, privacy, identity management, key man- agement, policy enforcement, and intrusion detection. The  goal of such a research work is to clearly point out what is needed, what lacks, and what must be done in order to realize a secure and privacy aware 5G network in the next future, taking in mind emerging paradigms, such as IoT, fog computing, and blockchain. Concerning fog computing, it should help in enhancing the overall network performance, by moving some network’s task towards the edge of the network system [6] ; while blockchain would give support to ensure adequate levels of robustness to the information transmitted [7] . In fact, the blockchain approach al- lows applications to operate in a decentralized or peer-to-peer fashion, without the need for a central authority or for other trusted intermedi- aries, as now required in mostly contexts. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the existing surveys and tutorials on 5G, pointing out the current state of the art in this  both in general and with a focus on security and privacy aspects. Section 3 deeply investigates security and privacy challenges in the 5G network. Section 4 provides a discussion about the outcomes of the conducted analysis. Section 5 ends the paper and draws some hints for future work. 2. Motivations and related works 5G is increasingly involving the researchers, due to the great impact it will certainly have in the Internet-based applications. In particular, it could become a major driver for the growth of IoT-related context. Many survey papers have been just proposed in literature, mainly focusing on the features and challenges of 5G protocol. As revealed by the following discussion, little attention has, until now, been paid on security and privacy requirements in the 5G communication standard. For example, the authors in [8] mainly concerns 5G network slic- ing techniques, which represent a central topic in the realization of the 5G mobile network architecture and in establishing how the network’s resources must be used from the physical to the higher layers. In fact, thanks to 5G network slicing, resources are split into logical or virtual networks (i.e., the slices) to address use cases with distinct features and service level agreement (SLA) requirements. In such a way, a 5G slice that supports, for example, a critical IoT use case would  in terms of throughput, latency and reliability requirements from another 5G slice which is dedicated to a non-critical application. The main challenges, concerning 5G network slicing, which have been pointed out in the sur- vey, are: (i) the virtualization of the radio resources; (ii) the  of  network functions to better compose the services; (iii) how to  perform and end-to-end orchestration and management of the provided services. [9] provides a wide overview of the next 5G generation, discussing about: (i) the new architectural changes associated to the design of the radio access network (RAN); (ii) the underlying novel physical layer technologies; (iii) the details of MAC layer protocols; (iv) the new QoS and QoE features, associated with the 5G evolution; (v) the energy con- sumption and cost  (vi) the relevant  trials, drive tests, and simulation experiments. The survey proposed in [10] , after presenting the limitations of the current cellular systems, discusses about some challenges in the develop- ment of 5G networks, such as: (i) data rate and network capacity expan- sion with energy optimization; (ii) scalability and  (iii) han- dling interference; (iv) low latency and high reliability; (v) high mobility and  (vi) self-healing infrastructures; (vii) QoS; (viii) security and privacy; (ix) economical impacts. Concerning security and privacy issues, the authors focus their attention on authentication, whose ac- tuation is hindered by the fast and frequent handover promised by 5G networks’ components. Hence, novel  solutions must be  in order to guarantee the end-devices authentication in the 5G scenario. Instead, a particular focus on RAN, core network, and caching in 5G networks is provided in [11] , in order to reveal how to achieve low latency, mainly in critical services, such as those belonging to the fol- lowing contexts: factory automation, intelligent transportation systems, robotics and telepresence, virtual and augmented reality, e-health, gam- ing, smart grid, remote learning/education. Other surveys focus on particular aspects of 5G networks, such as: • The millimeter wave (mmWave) bands [12] , which act an important role in guaranteeing high propagation loss, directivity, and sensitiv- ity to blockage in 5G communications • The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) at the radio access layer [13] [14] , which ensures more than one user can be served in each orthogonal resource block, such as a time slot, a frequency channel, a spreading code, or an orthogonal spatial degree of free- dom; note that, in such a work, security is mentioned as an open challenge and it was not considered when the NOMA principle was developed • The backhaul, which is pointed out as a bottleneck by the authors in [15] , due to the ultra-dense and heavy  cells connected to the core network through the backhaul itself • Multi-access edge computing (MEC) [16] , which could represent a viable solution to the just mentioned issues related to the 5G back- haul; in fact, MEC aims at providing a cloud computing platform  S. Sicari, A. Rizzardi and A. Coen-Porisini Computer Networks 179 (2020) 107345 at the edge of the radio access network,  at the same time, storage and computational resources at the edge, reducing latency for mobile end users • User association mechanisms [17] , which play a pivotal role in en- hancing the load balancing, the spectrum  and the energy  of networks; they mainly aim to determine whether a user is associated with a particular base station (BS), before initiating data transmission • Energy  techniques [18] , which inevitably  the re- sources’ allocation, both at the physical and at the radio access layer • Cooperative localization [19] , which should contribute to decrease communications’ delay.  tailored to the link between 5G and IoT, the survey, pre- sented by the authors in [20] , reveals that one fundamental challenge is the realization of a 5G-IoT architecture; the second challenge is how to guarantee security and privacy concerns, which can be listed as follows: identity, authentication, key management, encryption, secure mobility, and secure storage. A third challenge is, instead, related to standardiza- tion, which involves: (i) technology standards, including wireless com- munication, network protocols, data aggregation standards; (ii) regula- tory standards, including data security and privacy, such as general data protection regulation, cryptographic primitives, unstructured data, and data analysis algorithms. Seamlessly, the work in [21] deeply analyzes the communication technologies and challenges for the adoption of 5G networks for the IoT. It discusses the IoT application requirements, in the  of smart homes, intelligent transportation systems, smart cities, industries, and e-health, further revealing the new 5G radio enhancement in terms of multi-cast, mobility, and service continuity. [22] promotes the adoption of security solutions at the physical layer security by means of  techniques, including: physical layer security coding, massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) sys- tems, mmWave communications, heterogeneous networks, and NOMA. Finally, the work in [23] presents a comprehensive survey of exist- ing authentication and privacy-preserving schemes for 4G and 5G cel- lular networks. The authors outlined the threat model, by highlighting the attacks which can occur in a 5G network, and a categorization of authentication and privacy models. Their analysis is very deep and ac- curate, but leaves out some important issues, such as trust and access control. The scope of the work presented hereby is to investigate all the re- quirements related to security and privacy in the  of 5G, also with respect to the last emerging Internet-based technologies, such as IoT paradigm, fog computing, and blockchain [24] . Already available so- lutions, along with hints for future research directions will be clearly pointed out, in order to pave the way for a broader discussion on secu- rity and privacy in such a  More in detail, the following secure and privacy related features will be considered: • Integrity,  and non-repudiation • Authentication and access control • Key management • Privacy and identity management • Trust • Policy enforcement • Intrusion detection. Table 1 summarizes the topics covered by the just mentioned sur- veys on 5G. In this way, the  among the existing works and the one proposed in this paper are  More in detail, what emerge from the comparison is that the present paper entirely focuses on secu- rity and privacy issues related to 5G, while other papers are tailored to investigate other aspects, such as network resources’ management, architectural components, or performance metrics. Note that security requirements are only partially covered in other works. Note that some works available in literature refer only on IoT secu- rity and could be used as starting points for addressing security issues in Fig. 2. Scheme of a 5G network, including IoT and fog computing. the 5G-IoT domain. In such a direction should be interesting to analyze the following works [25] [26] [27] . 3. Security and privacy in the 5G In this section, the issues mentioned in Section 2 , which are re- lated to security and privacy in 5G networks, will be separately dis- cussed with respect to available solutions and taking in mind the 5G network scheme, proposed in Fig. 2 . Such a  represents a high level overview of a 5G-based system, where IoT devices are included and fog computing principles are applied. It is worth to remark that, in the considered analysis, only the existing approaches strictly targeted to 5G security and privacy are investigated, in order to clearly point out what has been already realized and what, instead, still lacks. More in detail, the following sections will deeply discuss, respec- tively, about: (i) integrity,  and non-repudiation; (ii) au- thentication and access control; (iii) key management; (iv) privacy and identity management; (v) trust; (vi) policy enforcement; (vii) intrusion detection. 3.1. Integrity,  and non-repudiation Integrity and  requirements are guaranteed if the con- tent and the owner of the data cannot be tampered or eavesdropped by a non-authorized entity. Finally, non-repudiation implies that a de- vice cannot declare to not be the owner of its generated information. Encryption techniques are usually adopted to deal with such issues. For example, the approach presented in [28] claims to have potential to achieve  integrity, availability and non-repudiation across the 5G based IoT networks, by integrating Elliptic Curve Cryp- tography (ECC) and Quantum Cryptography, in order to encrypt the information transmitted within the devices and base stations involved in the 5G system. Such a proposed solution is not evaluated with respect to its real feasibility and performance.  S.

Hence,
 
we

points
 
out
 
that
 
 S. Sicari, A. Rizzardi and A. Coen-Porisini Computer Networks 179 (2020) 107345 they commonly use three factors for authentication, including: (i) what you know (e.g., passwords); (ii) what you have (e.g., smart cards); (iii) who are you (e.g., biometrics). Furthermore, based on the categorization of authentication models, the surveyed schemes have been  in seven types, including: handover authentication, mutual authentica- tion, RFID authentication, deniable authentication, authentication with mutual anonymity, authentication and key agreement, and three-factor authentication. Some more recent works, not cited in [23] , include the cross-layer authentication protocol, designed in [34] for ultra-dense 5G networks. A channel-based  mechanism is employed to enhance the authentication procedure, generating an unpredictable secret key. Sub- sequently, a cryptographic mechanism, based upon the authentication and key agreement protocol, by employing the generated secret key, is performed for improving the  and integrity of the authen- tication handover. Furthermore, a radio trusted zone database, aiming to enhance the frequent authentication of radio devices, which are present in the network, is put in action. The proposed approach is evaluated in a limited scenario, thus not allowing to infer something about scalability. Instead, concerning access control, the work, which is proposed in [35] , presents the adoption of fog computing paradigm, for  managing the resources’ requests in presence of caching systems. In fact, revealing that fog-based caching systems may  from malicious ac- cess, to protect caching from violation and to further ensure its reli- ability, a new lightweight label-based access control scheme, able to authenticates the authorized fog nodes is provided. More in detail, fog nodes are authenticated by verifying the integrity of the shared  which consist in embedded label values, and only the authenticated fog nodes can access the caching service. Also inspired to fog computing, [36] presents a service-oriented au- thentication framework, supporting network slicing and fog nodes for 5G-enabled IoT services. End-users can establish connections with the 5G core network and anonymously access IoT services through proper network slices of 5G infrastructure, selected by fog nodes, by means of a group-based signature method. More in detail, neither service providers nor local fogs can gain any information about the subscribers (i.e., the end-users) of IoT services, but both are aware of whether end-users are legitimate to access IoT services. Furthermore, a three-party key agree- ment mechanism (based on  scheme), using session keys negotiated among users, local fogs and IoT servers, is put in place to guarantee secure access of service data in fog cache and remote servers. Also based on group-based authentication is the handover proto- col detailed in [37] for 5G wireless networks. Another solution for the handovers in 5G consists in adopting an anonymous mutual authentica- tion with key agreement, by exploiting the trapdoor collision property of chameleon hash functions and the tamper-resistance of blockchains [38] . Blockchain technology is also employed in [39] , for the realization of an authentication scheme in 5G ultra-dense networks, and in [40] , where consortium blockchain is employed. Note that, in the consortium blockchain, a selected set of nodes can determine the  decision on the consensus of a block, instead of including all the network’s partici- pants in the consensus process. Other authentication schemes are based on pseudonymous, which have been proposed, fox example, for VANET (i.e., vehicular ad hoc networks), but frequently  of expensive cost for their initial au- thentication, which may foster DoS attacks. To cope with such an issue, a hash puzzle-based co-authentication scheme is proposed in [41] . The hash puzzle is designed to restrict the attacker’s capability to forge fake pseudonymous  moreover, collaborative  is used to integrate the computing resources among legitimate vehicles, either as the   or the  owner. The data access control scheme, presented in [42] , makes also use of pseudonyms, but, in addition, it applies CP-ABE to encrypt and decrypt data encryption keys and the access policies are regulated by trust levels (see Section 3.4 ). A main goal achieved by such an approach is  ity, which implies that the proposed scheme can control communication data access no matter if the core network functionalities are available or not. A reputation system-based lightweight message, based on ECC, batch authentication framework and protocol for 5G-enabled vehicular net- works is also presented in [43] . A Trusted Authority (TA) is in charge of reputation management. In general, a vehicle with a reputation score be- low the given threshold cannot obtain a credit reference from the TA for participating in the communication; therefore, the number of untrusted messages in vehicular networks is reduced just from the source. Outcomes. What emerged is that authentication and access control are widely explored concepts already in the 5G era. The most recent solutions make use of three techniques: (i) group-based authentication; (ii) pseudonymous; (iii) ABE. Hence, it is possible to envision the  tion of a system where such three approaches work together, in order to enable a reliable authorization scheme and the protection of users’ and devices’ identities, for example, in the  macro and micro cells. Note that group signature has been widely adopted in literature, just from the  of security and privacy protocols for WSN [44] and Information Centric Networking (ICN) [45] . Essentially, only the mem- bers of a  group (i.e., the devices which belong to a cluster or to a portion of the network) can sign the transmitted messages with a previously agreed group signature. Such members, when receive a mes- sage, can verify that it contains a valid group signature, but they cannot discover which group member made it; such a feature prevents the iden- tities’ disclosure by the group members. In fact, only the group manager can open the signature and trace the original signer. Furthermore, the aforementioned analysis also pointed out the emerging role of fog com- puting and blockchain in the IoT-5G environment. Since they are novel techniques, their application still deserves further studies and evalua- tion, mainly to cope with the heterogeneity of the involved entities. 3.3. Key management Often the realization of clever key management mechanisms is over- looked, especially with respect to the  of encryption methods. However, the adoption of robust key distribution and replacement algo- rithms has the scope to improve the resilience of any networking-based system, thus enhancing the reliability of the services provided to the end-users. In fact, the availability of mechanisms in charge of revoking the actual keys and replacing them with new ones would help in coun- teracting the theft of credentials. Reaching such a goal is a complex task, due to dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the devices involved in 5G and, even more, in hybrid 5G-IoT networks. The aspect of key management is currently mainly treated, as regard the 5G context, in D2D communication and at the physical layer. In fact, [46] proposes a key distribution mechanism for D2D communication in 5G, for counteracting, in particular, the man-in-the-middle attack; the target scenario is composed by two devices belonging to the same cellular network and coverage. The proposed key exchange protocols are based on the standard  based key exchange and other lightweight cryptographic functions. Instead, the authors, in [47] , believe that physical layer security can be used to either provide direct secure data communication or facili- tate the distribution of cryptographic keys in the 5G network. However, no practical solution is provided and key management at the physical layer is until now reduced to credentials, which are pre-installed on the devices. The protocol presented in [48] aims at guaranteeing the privacy for the protected  of end-users’ devices and the mutual authen- tication, among such devices and the core network. The whole system is based on public keys and on IBE paradigm, but it is worth to remark that a key revocation mechanism is also provided. Such a mechanism depends on an expiration time, to prevent possible attacks. Outcomes. Clearly, the key management area in the IoT and, even more, in the 5G-based systems, still requires more attention by the re- search community, since few solutions  address such a con-  S. Sicari, A. Rizzardi and A. Coen-Porisini Computer Networks 179 (2020) 107345 cern. However, what emerges is the importance of the  scheme, which is a well-known  and robust mechanism for key negotiation in wireless systems. Moreover, it also scales, if integrated, for example with a group key exchange system [49] , which has been just introducted in Section 3.2 . Instead, to really consider the possibility to demand the key management and preservation at the physical layer, it is fundamental to assess the tamper-resistance of the involved devices and of the 5G network components. 3.4. Privacy and identity management Privacy is intended as the preservation of users’ sensitive informa- tion, which can also be derived from habits,  tracing, or in- ferred from other information, such as location or services’ preferences. Some application domains are more  by the presence of sensi- tive data, such as health monitoring and services,  analysis, smart retail, and so on. Vehicular networks, for example, could potentially gain a great ad- vantage with the  of 5G, since scalability and latency are the major drawbacks of current vehicular systems. However, security and privacy seamlessly represent critical issues, due to the kind of managed data (e.g., vehicles location, vehicles behavior) [50] . proposes a secure and privacy-aware cloud-assisted video reporting service, whose scope is to instantly report the videos of  accidents to the nearest  vehicle in order to improve safety on the roads. Great attention is paid to preserve the participating vehicle’s identity and the contents of the reported accident videos. The whole system is based on pseudonymous  and on public/private keys, which should guarantee the ve- hicles’ authentication, the non-repudiation of the video sent by vehicles, and traceability. Its main drawback is the presence of a TA, which is as- sumed to be fully trusted and strongly protected so as to be  for any adversary to compromise it. The TA is a centralized entity, thus it potentially represents a single point of failure. A similar solution is outlined in [51] . Another application  is that of 5G-based Vehicular Social Net- work (VSN), which needs to manage the privacy for vehicle’s location and trajectory, in an environment characterize by high mobility and multiple hops. Therefore, [52] constructs an architecture of 5G-based VSN with the Mobile Femtocell, and, then, proposes the Dynamic Group Division algorithm for privacy preserving, since it increases the chance of pseudonym exchanging with the proposed group generating protocol and pseudonym exchanging protocol. The work in [53] proposes a scheme based on a blockchain, with the scope of solving the privacy issues in content-centric mobile networks for 5G. Content-centric networks  of huge range of content re- quests, which also hinders the reliability of the whole system. Hence, the openness and tamper-resistant of the blockchain ledger is exploited to ensure the access control and privacy of the services’ provider; while the miner is selected by the users, so as to implement a sort of mutual trust among content providers and users. It is worth to remark that blockchain potentialities are really emerging in the last years; hence, such a tech- nology, mainly due to its distributed nature, seems very promising in the 5G  as long as issues related to the workload of blockchain itself are overcome. Another work which also exploits blockchain functional- ities for content-centric networks, towards the realization of a trusted 5G vehicular networks, is [54] . The purpose of [55] is to present how to achieve secure users’ digi- tal interactions for ensuring privacy in the future 5G networks. The pa- per concludes that a distributed ecosystem consisting of a Trusted Third Party (TTP) among the end-user and the service providers could be in- tegrated to secure the perspective of user controlled privacy. However, the  feasibility and limitations of such a system does not really emerge. Moving towards IoT context, another aspect to be considered is that, in order to allow an IoT application or digital service to use the net- work and its resources, the end-user must authenticate itself towards the service/application respective provider. To do this, a set of user credentials (i.e., username and password) is usually adopted to allow the user himself/herself to prove its authenticity towards the providers. However, the increasing number of available services and the need of in- creased security force the user to make various  combinations with strict rules to remember. To address such an issue and alleviate both users and service providers, mechanisms called identity federations were introduced, providing single sign-on solutions, which allow to sim- plify the registration and login processes for the user as well as reducing the costs for service providers, while handling with their Identity Man- agement Systems. Following such principles, [56] presents an identity federation solution. Fog computing is, instead, considered in [57] , in order to reduce the load of computational overhead for enhanced security protection at the user side. Here, a list of options should be available at the side of fog nodes, so that they can intelligently and dynamically adjust the desired level of security protection for users’ data. Note that cloud is perceived as an untrusted entity. Hence, such an idea of Quality of Protection (QoP) can be applied at the fog nodes in 5G networks, so that fog nodes can supply  levels of security protection to  data protection demands by users. Outcomes. Also with respect to privacy, there is a variety of strate- gies which can be put in action, in particular the use of pseudonymous and of identity federations. As also emerged in Section 3.1 , blockchain appears as viable solution, along with fog computing, for supporting the  of a privacy-aware 5G system. The main drawback re- lated to many privacy techniques is due to the presence of a TA or TTP, which potentially represent single points of failure for the whole system. Hence, a distributed approach should be envisioned, mainly due to the wide area covered by 5G networks. As an alternative, combining feder- ation techniques with fog computing and blockchain could represent an opportunity. It is worth to remark that  scalability and decen- tralization are the main requirements to take into account towards the  of solutions tailored to the 5G environment in order to not weigh down the network. 3.5. Trust The trust concept is used in various contexts and with  mean- ings. What is important is “how much ”an
 entity “knows ”another
 one. Such a relationship can be direct among the involved entities, or medi- ated by a  (and, so, trusted) authority. In general, trust is a complex notion about which no  consensus exists in the scien-  literature, although its importance is widely recognized. A main problem with many approaches towards trust  is that they do not lend themselves to the establishment of metrics and evaluation methodologies. For such a reason, the need of trust models is often over- looked, since the 4G era. Now that 5G is coming, it is fundamental to ensure a certain level of 5G networks trustworthiness towards the end- users, in order to encourage 5G  and adoption at a large scale. In general, people want to feel that they can trust the means by which they communicate their personal data. The authors, in [58] , mention trust, along with privacy protection and identity management, as critical challenges to be addressed in the 5G context, due to the fact that the promised 24/7 connectivity, in- volving heterogeneous devices, may generate a high number of at- tacks to be faced. Moreover, 5G enables immersive experiences, such as context-aware services, augmented reality, and concepts of anything- as-a-service and user customization, towards the provision of ubiquitous connectivity for smart objects in the IoT. These are the main motivation behind the need of a novel trust model tailored to the 5G domain, which still lacks. Dimensions of trust levels, instead of a hierarchical attribute struc- ture, are adopted in [42] (just presented in Section 3.2 ). More in detail, a number of trust impact factor, such as communication times or users’ vote, is considered to evaluate trust levels, which are further used to  S. Sicari, A. Rizzardi and A. Coen-Porisini Computer Networks 179 (2020) 107345 simplify the access policy by making it only based on such trust levels. On the basis of trust evaluation, CP-ABE primitives are exploited for the secret attributes’ key generation. The framework, proposed in [59] , applies adaptive trust evaluation and management, and sustainable trusted computing technologies to en- sure the computing platform trust and achieve security with the 5G core network. More in detail, it adopts cloud computing to securely deploy various trustworthy security services over the virtualized 5G networks. The main idea is to allow an authorized party to  a network- ing device’s trustworthiness, and to embed the authorized party’s poli- cies/criteria/rules into the trust insurance component of the device, to serve as a proof for the device itself. Tailored to the slicing service, the network slice trust degree con- cept, proposed in [60] , establishes the following trust degree calculation model: the network slice trust value is divided into three parts, namely, the network slice subjective trust value calculation based on the cloud model algorithm, the network slice history trust value calculation based user evaluation, the reward and punishment calculation when the slice runs. Such a task is performed by the network slice manager, which, during the process, sets reasonable weighting parameters for the above three parts, according to the  security requirements of the net- work slices. Outcomes. Note that the satisfaction of trust requirements is strictly related to the identity management and to the access control issues, treated in Sections 3.4 and 3.2 , respectively, because the  pro- tection and the supervisioning on the information’s disclosure must be considered as pillars, since information of any kind can travel across the 5G network. Usually, a score is assigned to the trustworthiness grade of each network’s actor, and its communication ability is suspended or de- nied in case the assigned score is lower than an established threshold. The main challenge is how to  which parameters, in a 5G envi- ronment, concur in the trust’s calculation. In fact, the actors, services, and information involved in the 5G network are so various and dynamic during the time that the trust model must, consequently, adapt to such rapid environment’s changes. Hence, conventional trust models must evolve towards a more  organization of the thresholds and  cient trust’s calculation algorithms must be put in action. 3.6. Policy enforcement Policy enforcement embraces the methods which are in charge of ensuring the actuation of  security and privacy policies on the data in a system. Policy enforcement is often represented by a mod- ule of the system itself, able to  the end-users’ requests and enable only the disclosure of authorized resources. As the key management, presented in Section 3.3 , also policy enforcement is often overlooked by the research community, which fosters the  of encryption and authentication schemes. However, the  of accurate policies is fundamental for guaranteeing an adequate protection of the information managed within the network. The authors of [61] advocate that 5G must do its best to eliminate malicious  which is the main cause of failure of legitimate ser- vices (e.g., source address  DoS). Therefore, they propose that all communications in 5G should be controlled by policies, which should facilitate the cooperation of customer networks against misbehaving en- tities and the collection of evidence of malicious activity in real time. Dynamic policies can also react to hosts that are used in attacks. More in detail, contrary to the current Internet model, where any host can send a packet to any address, in [61] , all communications are granted de- pending on the policy, which allows the receiver to decide what  it wants to receive, thus minimizing its risk. The policy  puts the receiver in charge of managing the  admission, so as to balance the needs of the receiver with those of the sender. The underlying archi- tecture is composed of edge switches, thus following the fog computing concept. Seamlessly, the architecture described in [62] aims to automatically manage the network anomaly detection by using policies. By means of three types of policies and an orchestration process, in charge of making policy actions, the proposed system can deploy  actions to as- sure an  anomaly detection process in real time. Note that policy actions establish the behavior of the network resources according to pa- rameters, such as: network  detection of anomalies, amount and mobility of users, and current state of the network resources. The authors, in [63] , propose to actuate policy enforcement mecha- nisms in 5G by means of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). How- ever, no hints for a concrete design of a such a kind of architecture are provided. Similarly, the service-oriented network resource slicing scheme, pre- sented in [64] , includes an inter-slice policy enforcement, which should ensures that each slice receives the corresponding network orchestra- tion policy,  priority and frame  The format of the policies is, however, not clearly  Outcomes. With respect to policy enforcement, the proposed ap- proaches are not presented in a clear way, mainly concerning the policy format and  Another crucial aspect regards how policies are managed and updated, mainly due to the dynamicity of IoT-5G network, which is higher than current existing application domains. In fact, a pol- icy update should be extended to the whole network for being  As emerged by the conducted analysis, policies are currently adopted to support anomaly detection processes (which will be discussed in the next Section 3.7 ) and, therefore, to recognize and react to possible net- work’s attack. Instead, policies should also have the role or regulating the access to the 5G network’s resources, in combination with a proper access control framework, as presented in Section 3.2 . 3.7. Intrusion detection The intrusion detection systems (IDS) involve all the mechanisms aimed at preventing, recognizing, and, sometimes, counteracting possi- ble attacks, which can occur within the network (e.g., DoS, man-in-the- middle, tampering, etc.). IDS can be also put in relation with policies’  and management, as emerged in the previous Section 3.6 . The need of extending the coverage region of connectivity, required the introduction of new wireless components in the 5G networks, such as small cell access points and hotspots. However, such components are highly vulnerable to security breaches and provides an easy entry point for the intruder to enter into the network. The work in [65] focuses on the implementation of an IDS using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. A neural network model is, also, employed in [66] , for intrusion clas-  and prediction in 5G-IoT networks. Such a method uses the capability of learning complex patterns and behaviors to  between normal  and network attacks. A similar approach adopts an adaptive IDS using a hidden Markov Model for detecting an intrusion on small cell access points in the 5G wireless communication networks [67] . Also, the work in [68] follows an adaptive approach to recognize intrusions on the relay, small cell access point and base station, which realize a multistage 5G wireless communication network. Instead, location-aware mobile intrusion prevention system, envis- aged for 5G, is proposed in [69] . The Intrusion Detection Message Ex- change Format (IDMEF) is used for activating the IDS alerts, and, in conjunction with the Intrusion Detection Exchange Protocol (IDXP), for transmitting the alerts from the mobile IDS sensors to a security oper- ations center. The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is used for authentication in a federated environment, and the well-known dy- namic eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) based poli- cies are used for authorization and security obligations in the mobile devices. Note that the alerts are anonymized along with location data, to avoid that sensitive information leaks out. Such a shrewdness avoids that location information can easily be linked to the device being mon-  S.

on

volved,
 
which
 
include,

the
 
5G-IoT
 
scenario,
 
heterogeneous
 
devices,
 
so
 
as
 
a
 
multitude
 
of
 

 
kinds
 
of
 
information
 
has
 
to
 
be
 
handled.
 
As
 
shown
 
in
 
Fig.
 
2
 
,
 
5G
 
is
 
conceived
 
as
 
a
 
network
 
composed
 
of
 
macro-
 
cells
 
and
 
micro-cells,
 
where
 
proper
 
base
 
stations
 
and/or
 
hotspots
 
must
 
be
 
installed,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
guarantee
 
a
 
pervasive
 
connectivity.
 
Such
 
com-
 
ponents
 
may
 
be
 
further
 
connected
 
to
 
a
 
cloud,
 
thus
 
requiring
 
an
 

 
management
 
of
 
the
 
IoT
 
request
 
at
 
fog
 
layer,
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
reduce
 
com-
 
munication
 
and
 
computation
 
at
 
the
 
cloud
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
possible,
 
while
 
supporting
 
scalability
 
of
 
service
 
provision,
 
as
 
discussed
 
in
 
[71]
 
.
 
Moreover,
 
the
 
transmitted
 
data
 
also
 
require
 
to
 
be
 
processed
 
in
 
some
 
ways
 
and,
 
to
 
this
 
end,
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
a
 
“fog
 
layer
 
”seems
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
viable
 
solution,
 
mainly
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
advent
 
of
 
IoT
 
applications,
 
which
 
re-
 
quire
 
to
 
handle,
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
possible
 
close
 
to
 
the
 
end-devices,
 
the
 
huge
 
amount
 
of
 
acquired
 
information
 
to
 
be
 
further
 
shared
 
with
 
interested
 
users.
 
Hence,
 
the
 
fog
 
computing
 
concept
 
expects
 
that
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
smart
 
devices
 
belonging
 
to
 
the
 
“fog
 
”layer
 
of
 
the
 
network
 
acts
 
as
 
intermedi-
 
aries
 
between
 
the
 
end-users/sources,
 
and
 
the
 
core
 
network.
 
They
 
are
 
essentially
 
conceived
 
as
 
powerful
 
devices,
 
routers,
 
or
 
gateways,
 
owning
 
processing
 
capabilities
 
to
 
be
 
exploited
 
to
 
perform
 

 
computing
 
tasks,
 
such
 
as
 
data
 
elaboration
 
or
 
aggregation,
 
algorithms’
 
execution,
 
and
 
security
 
tasks
 
[4]
 
.
 
Hence,
 
fog
 
nodes
 
can
 
be
 
represented
 
as
 
proxies,
 
which
 
are
 
also
 
able
 
to
 
provide
 
cryptographic
 
computations;
 
while
 
the
 
underlying
 
IoT
 
devices
 
and
 
sensors
 
lack
 
the
 
necessary
 
resources
 
to
 
do
 
such
 
tasks.
 
Hence,
 
fog
 
computing
 
not
 
only
 
provides
 
additional
 
computa-
 
tional
 
resources
 
to
 
the
 
network,
 
but
 
also
 
a
 
further
 
level
 
of
 
security
 
that
 
could
 
help
 
in
 
preventing,
 
minimizing,
 
and
 
also
 
counteracting
 
attacks
 
in
 
the
 
5G-IoT
 
environment.
 
Furthermore,
 
the
 
adoption
 
of
 
fog
 
computing
 
paradigm
 
could
 
help
 
in
 
preserving
 
privacy
 
of
 
IoT
 
data
 
and
 
in
 
protect-
 
ing
 
users’
 
sensitive
 
information
 
by
 
reducing
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
transmit
 
certain
 
kinds
 
of
 
data
 
to
 
the
 
core
 
network.
 
However,
 
such
 
an
 
approach
 
also
 
intro-
 
duces
 
several
 
challenges
 
concerning
 
data,
 
location’s,

The following questions naturally emerge: • How to continuously guarantee adequate QoS levels, in presence of both mobility and security&privacy mechanisms? • How to protect the information related to IoT-devices’ location? • How to manage the authentication in presence of multiple ser- vices, network’s  and considering the mobility of end- devices? • How to manage encryption/decryption keys’ update or revocation, in presence of cryptography algorithms? The answers to such questions would require an  both in terms of hardware and protocols. Moreover, new proposed approaches must take into account the energy and computational constraints of end IoT devices. 4.2. The role of blockchain Blockchain technology has recently attracted the interest of stake- holders across  industrial activities, ranging from  (the  and most famous use is in cryptocurrency), healthcare, product traceability, real estate, smart cities, smart homes, and so on [7] , thus paving the way for its adoption in various application context and, more  in the IoT [73] . But, as emerged in Section 3 , a limited role for blockchain is also emerging in the 5G environment. A block in a blockchain contains the following information: • A set of transactions (i.e., the data content) • A timestamp • A cryptographic hash function, such as merkle tree or binary hash tree, which is exploited by the blockchain in order to address block’s integrity; in such a way, a further level of security is introduced • A reference to the preceding block, so as to identify the current block’s place in the blockchain; note that, since each block references the hash of the block that came before it, a link between the blocks is established, thus creating a chain of blocks, named blockchain • If needed, the so-called smart contracts, which are scripts that allow the coding and execution of computing programs on the blockchain itself; note that such scripts may contains access policies, which can be  and enforced by the blockchain itself, preventing unau- thorized operations on data. The advantages of blockchain, obviously in terms of security, can be summarized as follows: • Decentralization : blockchain does not need a centralized authority in charge of supervisioning the system’s behavior and dictating the rules or policies to be applied at each time; moreover, the transac- tions are validated by all (or by a group of) the network’s compo- nents, thus avoiding to delegate such a task to a central entity • Distribution of the information : since each network’s components holds a copy of the blockchain, there is (again) no need of a central- ized authority which keep such information privately • Data transparency and auditability : since a full copy of each trans- action executed within the system is stored in the blockchain and since the blockchain is public to all the peers, then it is always possi- ble to trace and monitor what happens in the network, guaranteeing that operations are legitimate • Robustness : the blockchain is tamper-proof, hence it cannot be ma- nipulated by malicious parties. Ad a consequence, by adopting a blockchain, applications that usu- ally run only through a trusted intermediary, can now operate in a decentralized fashion, without the need for a central authority, and achieve the same functionalities. Furthermore, it is worth to remark that some blockchain’s features provide an answer to some of the questions raised in Section 4.1 , such as the monitoring of network’s activities, and end-to-end security. Even if blockchain seems to be the perfect solution to solve the some of the proposed challenges, it also  of some drawbacks [7] , which are: (i) high resource demand for verifying the validity of a block; (ii) long latency for transactions’  (iii) low scalability, due to the broadcasting transactions and blocks to the whole network. Such limits can be faced by integrating the blockchain mechanism in the fog layer, so as to delegate to fog nodes the heavi- est tasks, but future solutions must seriously pay attention to maintain the  of 5G technology with respect to the adopted security and privacy methods. 4.3. Challenges and future directions The previous Sections 4.1 and 4.2 pointed out the importance of the recent fog computing and blockchain paradigms and also raised some important questions, which deserve responses in order to ensure a proper level of reliability to 5G-IoT systems. In light of the analysis conducted in Sections 3 , it is now possible to summarize the open chal- lenges and future research directions in the  of security and privacy in 5G-IoT networks. Note that the implementation of 5G will be pur- sued by many current and developing technologies, such as: (i) Hetero- geneous Networks (HetNets); (ii) Software  Networks (SDNs); (iii) Massive MIMO; (iv) Multiple Radio Access. All such technologies come with their own security challenges. For example, HetNets require frequent handover, which directly  the authentication process in the network, especially with the small latency requirement of 5G. Also, cloud computing and SDNs cause an increment in the number of DDoS attacks due to the On-Demand Self-Service feature of cloud computing. Although the authentication and robustness of SDN are addressed by having a decentralized control and exploiting user-dependent security context, the security of 5G and all the emerging technologies involved in 5G must be more extensively addressed, in order to ensure security and privacy to be guaranteed to the end-users. Data protection. With respect to data protection, as emerged in Sections 3.1 , sec:sec4 and 3.6 , a central role is acted by the encryption mechanisms. Some ciphering techniques have been  in the pro- posed solutions, which range from AES and RSA to other more recent, maybe more suitable for resource constrained devices, ECC and Quan- tum Cryptography. Such mechanisms can be adopted to encrypt both data contents and location’s information, in order to preserve their con-  and integrity and to guarantee privacy for the users’ sensitive information. It is worth to remark that ECC provides short key lengths, reduced message sizes and lower resource usages; hence, ECC should not compromise the  of 5G communications. The small size of the keys, with respect, for example, to RSA, makes the ECC an ideal choice for devices with limited storage or data processing resources, which are increasingly common in the  of IoT. Moreover, if fog nodes  some of computation and storage overheads from devices in proximity, then a better scalability is achieved; also, less overhead in storage and communications is provided with respect, as just mentioned, to RSA based schemes, employed in SSL/TSL, guaranteeing the same level of security. Another fundamental issue is how to distribute and protect the credentials, owned by the involved devices, and recover the system in case of violation. Resource disclosure. Concerning access control and authentication, some promising approaches have been cited and could represent rele- vant starting points for further investigations in the area, such as the adoption of group signatures or pseudonyms. Traditional public key infrastructure-based authentication schemes may provide networks with identity authentication and conditional privacy protection, which are  S. Sicari, A. Rizzardi and A. Coen-Porisini Computer Networks 179 (2020) 107345 not enough for assessing the reliability of information. Additionally, al- though 5G can dramatically improve the data transmission  many existing authentication schemes are based on complex bilinear pairing operations, and the calculation time is too long to be suitable for delay-sensitive 5G-enabled networks, as emerged in Section 3.2 . To cope with such an issue, ABE mechanisms could be adapted to 5G needs. In fact, ABE mechanisms allow to encrypt data for multiple recipients, in such a way that only those recipients whose attributes satisfy a given access policy can decrypt afterwards. A distributed architecture, result- ing from the combination of 5G and fog computing, is an ideal candidate to actuate proper measures to grant access tokens to authorized parties, who use them to perform given actions (e.g., data decryption). Also, a fog computing platform can be used as a sort of distributed trust au- thority to authorize access and disclose data among authorized parties and end-devices. New solutions should enable and encourage the con- trol on the data by the owners themselves, which should be provided with the necessary means for establishing, in an autonomous or semi- autonomous way, how to share their information. Such an approach is mainly due to the dimension of future 5G-IoT networks, which should distribute as much as possible the tasks to perform. In such a direction, another feasible approach is that of sticky policies [74] . Sticky policies are transmitted along with the data they refer to throughout the entire data life cycle. The concept of sticky policy is to attach security and privacy policies to owners’ data and drive access control decisions and policy enforcement. Sticky policies allow specifying access rule in an extremely  manner: in principle every data unit could have its own, unique, policy. Furthermore, as policies ’travel’ with the data across the entire system, they could provide protection over the entire data life cycle, independently from the network dimension. In this sense, sticky policies could help users to pursue their rights and actively man- age the rules to be applied to their own information. Such an approach represents a fundamental step for improving the trustworthiness of the users with respect to the future 5G service providers and for avoiding improper resources’ use or disclosure. Furthermore, ABE or sticky pol- icy based mechanisms could be integrated in a blockchain, to provide a further level of security to the transmitted information. Trust and rogue node detection. As emerged from Sections 3.2 and 3.5 , some access control systems typically require the presence of a TA or TTP in order to manage access permissions to resources. Moreover, there is usually the presence of an entity responsible for managing, in some ways, the reputation of the network’s participants. But, in such a scenario, is it possible to envision a system, where parties are only par- tially trusted (e.g., honest-but-curious)? Or the end-devices must trust the fog nodes and, in turn, the fog nodes must trust the core network? Summarizing, a sort of “chain of trust ”must
 be  designed for 5G environments, taking into account all the entities involved and the parameters to be evaluated. Moreover, the end-devices are vulner- able to physical attacks, since they are far from the core network and communications take place over the 5G network. To ensure end-to-end security, it is also essential to protect the devices against hardware tam- pering or electromagnetic eavesdropping. Another fundamental concern is that most end-devices and fog nodes are usually remotely managed. The remote management  opportunities for adversaries to conduct various network-based attacks, and makes the detection and mitigation of such attacks more  and expensive. Monitoring, logging, reporting . Monitoring, logging, and report- ing represent crucial requirements for any security system, since they also allow to detect attacks ( Section 3.7 ) and check the ability of the system to behave as expected, in response of occurring situations. In the case of 5G, and even more if it is integrated with fog nodes, such a mon- itoring should cover the whole data life-cycle. Such an aspect represents a distinctive feature with respect to traditional monitoring and detection solutions, which usually involve a limited area. In a 5G based system, the most part of the network is not considered trusty, thus forcing to run the monitoring, logging, and reporting tasks towards the end-devices and network’s components. Recognizing issues will allow to trigger proper  for allowing the system to promptly react to violations and threats. Also, the attacks propagation should be inhibited. Further considerations . Other relevant aspects, which are not treated in this work because they are not directly tailored to security and privacy, are: (i) the  of performance and low-overhead mechanisms for 5G communications, able to preserve bandwidth and network’s resources [75] or to save energy (i.e., towards green 5G net- works) [76] ; (ii) the put in action of standardization processes, which are already active thanks to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [77] , which should help in  common interfaces and pro- tocols, to guarantee the maximum interoperability within the 5G net- work; (iii) existing platform and tools , which can be used to evaluate and test new contribution in the 5G  [16] ; (iv) ongoing projects and activities all over the world, which are discussed in [2] . 5. Conclusion As emerged from the analysis conducted in this paper, the real spreading of 5G network, and the consequent services provision, require the design of novel security and privacy solutions, in order to guaran- tee, in a capillary way, the reliability and the robustness over the whole system. The overview provided with such a survey arises many open issues, and sheds some light on research directions in the 5G security  More in detail, a  vision regarding the insurance of security and privacy requirements in such an environment, mainly characterized by very low latency, is still missing. Suitable solutions need to be devel- oped; they should be independent from the involved devices, but should take into account the architecture of the 5G-based system itself. More- over, the new proposed approaches must guarantee: integrity,  tiality, non-repudiation, authentication methods, access control, privacy for information and devices, trustworthiness among the 5G network’s components and end-users, and compliance with  security and privacy policies. Much  are being spent by the worldwide scien-  community to address aforementioned topics, but there are still many open challenges to be faced. We do hope that the discussion we provided can be of interest for various audiences, including most notably PhD candidates, research consortia and IT industry, in order to pursue in the realization of secure and privacy-aware 5G infrastructures.
