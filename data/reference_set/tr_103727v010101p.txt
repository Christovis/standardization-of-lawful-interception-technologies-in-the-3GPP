Introduction 
The objective of the present document is to enable the 
exchange of information between Law Enforcement Agencies 
(LEAs), for example across the European Union and other partne
rs or associated countries in the context of e-Evidence. 
For this purpose, the ETSI TS 102 232 family ([i.6] for part 1) of specification for LI, and ETSI TS 103 707 [i.2] related 

to messaging aspects for OTT CSPs, and the Inter LEA Handover Interface (ETSI TS 103 462 [i.5]), are used as 
lingua 
franca
 and are complemented by national formats when necessary. For matters related to Lawful Disclosure the same 
approach is taken with ETSI TS 102 657 [i.3] and ETSI TS 103 120 [i.4]. 
In a first part, mapping aspects between the indicated ET
SI specifications and national formats are considered. The 
second part, which starts with clause 7, provides a library
 covering operational aspects such as connection parameters 
between the requesting and responding Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF) or specific parameter formats 
(checklists, see also Annexes B and C of the present document). 
The present document is not intended to promote the use of 
national formats, rather, it takes into account the existing 
situation (as of publication) with a view towards increased use of ETSI specifications. 
    ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 6 1 Scope 
The present document describes the handling of national parameters and implementations in the context of the Inter 
LEA Handover Interface and cross-border data exchange in criminal matters, e.g. through Mutual Legal Assistance 

Treaty (MLAT) or using the secure European Judicial Network. In combination with the Inter LEA Handover 

Interface (ILHI) specification this is a practical guidelin
e for Law Enforcement Agencies and vendors of LEMF. 
One aspect is the mapping of national data structures and single parameters into a related ETSI standard and, if 

necessary, also the mapping back into the national structure. 
In addition, the present document gives an overview about the necessary parameters for the handover itself in the form 
of a library (checklists) for Lawful Interception (LI) and Lawful Disclosure (LD). For the library no special values for 

the parameters are specified, but the (bilateral) tuning of thes
e parameters is facilitated. For the deployment cases where 
no ETSI conformant implementation is available, the present document provides examples of mapping between national 

formats and the ETSI format for LI. 
The juridical aspects for using the provided mapping are out of scope of the present document. 
The considerations provided in the present document do not modify, override, or otherwise introduce incompatible 
changes to ETSI or national standards, nor do they pres
cribe requirements on communication service providers.

4 Overall aspects 
4.1 Operational considerations There exist technical and operational aspect
s that are outside the scope of the present document, in particular handling 

of operational and confidential information that cannot be provided herein. This includes, but is not limited to: 
• Maintenance of mapping tables: 
- Technical update of the mapping (for example, the mapping tables or methods could be updated). 
- Description of the mapping in a distributable document (e.g. in a specification). 
  ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 9 - Configuration management including version management and archival of mappings. 
- Notification procedures between responsible parties regarding such updates. 
- Platform for information exchange of mapping updates. 
• VPN configuration, for example: 
- Technical configuration (communication system, protocols, algorithms, encryption procedures, 
key management). 
- Registration and acceptance procedures. 
Several options are available to responsible authorities for the handling of out-of-scope information, which may decide: 
• To include such information as an informative annex to the present document. 
• To disclose such information within the European Judicial Network (EJN)/e-Codex/eEDES. 
• To disclose such information as part of bilateral agreements between the issuing and executing authorities. 
4.2 Connectivity Enabling information exchange between Law Enforcement Agen
cies implies that systems share compatible connection 
parameters at transport level. This is particularly relevant for aspects that are not fully defined in the ETSI TS 102 232 

family ([i.6] for part 1) of specifications for LI and for example ETSI TS 102 657 [i.3] and ETSI TS 103 120 [i.4] for 

LD. These aspects are summarized in clause 7 whil
e details are left to national implementation. 
4.3 Information security and accuracy 
For the transfer of information through ILHI mechanisms are 
needed to ensure at least integrity protection and proof of 

origin of the data. These mechanisms can be built into the transport layers or into the application layer. 
In addition to the traditional requirements for information security, a translation mechanism between the ETSI formats 
for LI and LD, and national formats introduces additional requirements on the usability of the data. Indeed, the data is to 

be used in investigations and legal proceedings (also as e-evidence), implying several properties that are listed below: 
• Data translated from one format to another retains its semantic value, i.e. the two parameters represent the 

same type of information (e.g. an IP address) even if the format is different. 
• When data is translated, it remains accurate (i.e. the representation unit and value of a datum is not modified). 
• When data is imported into a national system, where such data is not defined by the national framework, it is 

to be annotated in such a way that it can be interpreted without doubt. 
• The digital processes transforming the data are repeatable and deterministic as defined in ETSI 

TS 103 643 [i.11]. 
• As an extension, non-purely digital processes such as digital scans or OCR are also repeatable and 

deterministic, in the sense that they always lead to equivalent results for all intend and purpose. 
The high-level reference model to be used for guaranteei
ng information security and accuracy during the mapping 
process is illustrated in figure 4.3-1. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 10  Figure 4.3-1: Reference model for the mapping 
process between requesting and responding LEMF 
The following information is exchanged in the reference model: 
• ILHI-Data: Payload of the requested data. 
• Control: Connectivity for e.g. the tasking process keep-alive or error messages. 
4.4 Handling of mapping details 
Procedures are needed to identify and remedy cases where it 
is not possible to translate data between the ETSI format 
and the national format. Such procedures are described in clauses specific to each mapping. 
5 Mapping methods 
5.1 Overview 
The present clause introduces common mapping methods that can be used when converting data instantiated according 
e.g. to the ETSI TS 102 232 ([i.6] for part 1) family of specifications and national formats. Beyond the general case, LI 

and LD specific methods, as well as real-time aspects, are considered. 
An example mapping is provided in Annex A of the present document. In order to keep track of future mappings, it is 
envisioned that such mappings, or their references (if they ar
e confidential), will be collected
 in revisions of the present 
document or will be stored in a registry, to ensure awareness among Law Enforcement Agencies on the matter of 

cross-border data exchange. 
5.2 Mapping management 
5.2.1 Generalities 
A mapping is always defined against a specification number and version. For example, ETSI TS 102 232-2 [i.1] with 

German TR TKÜV version 7.1 [i.8]. This allows the reques
ting and responding parties to determine usability of a 
mapping and to manage mappings according to changes implemen
ted either in the ETSI specifications or in the national 
specifications. 
Because a mapping involves two sets of specifications, it is useful to name parameters differently to help the reader 
quickly understand where the parameter is coming from. For example, parameters coming from one set of specifications 

can be named 
fields
, while parameters coming from the other set of specifications can be named 
elements. These names 
can be chosen according to the data format (typically, the name 
elements suits the XML convention). 
There are cases where data formats can hold parameters with the same name in different positions of the data structure. 
Yet, these parameters are distinct and could be subject to different mapping rules. In such situation, it is recommended 
that the mapping includes a convention for locating a parameter within the relevant data structure. For example, 

XPath [i.14] can be used in the case of XML [i.13]. In the 
case of ASN.1, a convention can be to use a string containing 
each intermediary object, in the order of traversal, separated by dots. An example is given in clause A.2.2.3.1.

least on configuration of required support services and interconnections, as well as acceptance and management 

procedures, as described in clause 4.1.

To facilitate identification and version control, it is recommended that a master version identifier (such as a version 

number) be assigned to each instantiation of the combination of the mapping documentation and ancillary 

documentation, such as instantiations that are (or were) in force as well as intermediary development versions. Within 
each instantiation, mapping documentation and ancillary documentation can also be versioned and summarized in a 
manifest to allow exhaustive inventory and avoid mistakes in the handling of mapping-related documents between the 

parties. It is recommended that the parties agree a versioning scheme for this purpose. Figure 5.2.2-1 below provides a 

documentation hierarchy example. Each compon
ent in the hierarchy can be versioned. 
 Figure 5.2.2-1: Documentation hierarchy example 
The mapping tables are expected to be part of the documen
tation as reference for administrators and system operators. 
They can also be declared in machin
e-readable form usable by the Mapping Function (clause 6.1 of the present 
document) or by the requesting party for the automatic identification of usable data through valuation indicators 

(clause 6.2 of the present document). 
5.2.3 Fully specified mapping 
To ensure trust on the data by the requesting LEMF it is recommended that the mapping between the national format 

and ETSI TS 102 232 ([i.6] for part 1) family and other relevant specifications (for example ETSI TS 103 120 [i.4]) be 

fully documented and made available to all relevant stakeholders. 
5.3 General methods 
5.3.1 Name change 
Differences in names are to be accounted for in the mapping rules between two formats. 
5.3.2 Translation between sets 
Parameters that can hold typed values (for example, flags) can have different values in each format, yet for each value 

of a parameter in a format, there will be a semantic equivalent in the other format. The mapping rules between the two 

formats are to provide clear correspondence rules between the two sets. Table A.2.2.3.1-1 provides an example of such 

translation.

5.3.3 Format change 
Parameters referring to the same data across two formats can be represented by different data types. This can be the case 
e.g. with phone numbers, timestamps, and location data but also basic data types such as integers and strings, which 
would also require careful considerations. The mapping is to
 provide clear rules to ensure proper conversion. In some 
cases, the conversion can lead to partial data loss, such as a loss in accuracy. 
NOTE: Whether a loss in accuracy is relevant under clause 4.3 of the present document is to be evaluated on a 
per-parameter basis. This information can be conveyed through valuation indicators as defined in 
clause 6.2. 
For example, phone numbers are represented in E.164 notation in ETSI TS 102 657 [i.3], location data is represented in 

WGS84 notation in ETSI TS 103 462 [i.5], and timestamps are represented in QualifiedDateTime or 

QualifiedMicrosecondDateTime notation in ETSI TS 103 280 [i.10]. 
5.3.4 Encodings 
It can be necessary to convert data from one encoding to 
another. For example, between an octet string (binary string) 
representation or one of the ASN.1 encoding rules to base64. In
 such case, the specificities of each encoding is to be 
accounted for in order to prevent data corru
ption. This entails making sure that the set of possible values for raw data is 
the same in both encodings, or at least, the same for the conversion being considered. Sometimes this is not possible, in 
particular when comparing an encoding designed for transp
ort to an encoding designed for data representation and 
processing, where the latter puts limits on what is valid data. Thus, it can become necessary to select a destination 
encoding that is not optimal for the representation of the data
 but allows transport between LEMF and processing by the 
requesting LEMF. A simple illustration of this problem is the digitization of physical documents. Table A.2.3.3.1-1 

provides an example of such encodings.

5.4 LI and real-time specific methods 
The mapping is to consider several real-time or near real
-time operations, that can have an impact for delivery across 
ILHI: 
• Real-time transcoding of Content of Communication (CC), when different codecs are used. 
• Real-time translation into CC-related LI-PS-PDU headers. 
• Translation into IRI, whereby the responding side translates IRI from the national format to the relevant ETSI 
format, while the requesting side will possibly need to post-process the data, for example by looking-up 

identifiers. 
5.5 LD and non-real-time specific methods 
The mapping is to consider implementations aspects related to the processing of data at rest, such as data storage 

capabilities and processing of the data. Alth
ough the handover of LD data is expected to be mostly non real-time and 
can accommodate manual processing when automation is not possible, two aspects in particular are noteworthy: 
• Firstly, data that has been provided to an LEA as 
part of Lawful Disclosure can have been subject to 
application layer protection measures arranged between the LEA and the originating CSP, such as encryption, 

proof of origin, and integrity protection, that depend on security parameters managed by the CSP and the LEA. 

Were the data to be provided to the requesting party as-is, it would not be possible for the requesting party to 

validate its security properties involving the originating 
CSP. If these are still present, it is recommended that 
the responding party removes the protection artefacts applied to the data by the originating CSP, and only 
applies those protection that have been agreed with 
the requesting party as part of the mapping (refer to 
clauses 7.4 and 7.5). 
• Secondly, LD data, especially business data, can be in formats and languages that are not by default supported 
by the requesting party (for example, contracts are not written in an official language of the requesting party). 

The responding party will likely not be in a position to transform the LD data, as these can be in different 
formats in both jurisdictions, that have not been standardised at an international or even national level. It is 
recommended that the nature, format and languages of th
e LD data be examined during the establishment of 
the mapping, for the purpose of informing the requesting party. 
The E-evidence homepage maintained by the EU Commission services [i.12] can help finding further information on 

non-real-time requirements for cross-border data exchange.

6.1 Overview 
The present clause provides information on the mapping 
function and the various aspects to be considered when 
handling a mapping. A high-level view of the mapping definition and the mapping function is given in figures 6.1-1 and 
6.1-2. 
 Figure 6.1-1: Relationship between national a
nd ETSI formats through the Mapping definition 
 Figure 6.1-2: Data transformation through the Mapping Function 
Depending on the service type or data format, a Mapping is defined that describes the correspondence between a 

specific national format and the ETSI ILHI PS PDU/XML schema format (figure 6.1-1). This Mapping is taken as input 

to the Mapping Function (MapF) that transforms data instantiated in a national format into data instantiated in the ETSI 

format through a transformation engine (figure 6.1-2). Further details regarding the Mapping Function are described in 

the following clauses.

1-11) 15 6.2 Information on translation accuracy and data 
trustworthiness - valuation indicators 
The translation engine evaluates a transl
ated item according to its knowledge of 
the translation rule: either the rule 
allows 100 % accuracy translation, or it is technically known that it is not the case. The receiving party can find this 
information in the mapping table in the form of an additional indicator on accuracy, more generally named a valuation 
indicator on accuracy. A valuation indicator expresses the 
quality of the mapping information based on a technical 
assessment conducted during its establishment. The ma
pping table and Valuation Indicators (VI) are exchanged 
out-of-band between the parties (see figure 6.1-2). 
Similarly, a 
valuation indicator on completeness
 can be used to indicate whether the mapping allows a particular 
piece of data to be translated in full (without loss of data). 
The 
evaluation of the mapping quality
 (accuracy and completeness of the translated data) is not a real-time operation, 
it is the result of a study of the options available to the responding and requesting parties for the conversion of data from 
a national format to the ETSI format. When the sending an
d receiving party agree on a mapping, the indications of 
accuracy and completeness are used as formal reference by both parties. For cases where a translation does not permit 

full accuracy or completeness of specific data, both parties ar
e to decide whether said data is to be converted and 
handed over through the mapping function, or whether it is to be handed over in its original form through the 
originalPayload mechanism, possibly with the responding authority providing assistance to the requesting authority for 
the interpretation of the data. 
It can be tempting to label data as 
not suitable for evidence
 as a result of a technical evaluation of a mapping method, 
and to document this in the mapping documentation. In some co
untries this would not be appropriate because that is a 
matter which would be assessed by the court based on the situ
ation under consideration. Fo
r example: a location with a 
possible inaccuracy of up to 5 km would still be suitable in ev
idence as a way to indicate that the individual in question 
was not 1 000 km away from the specified location (e.g. could safely be used to cast doubt on an assertion that the 
individual took a flight at a given time). In this situation it would be unhelpful and incorrect to have marked that 

location as 
not suitable for evidence
. It is therefore recommended to evaluate the mapping methods on their technical 
merit, and to select the originalPayload mechanism in case the mapping method would not be technically suitable. 
Tables 6.2-1 and 6.2-2 provide guidance on how to handle the information provided by the valuation indicators.

Comment
 The data is to be handled in 
the mapping 
The mapping method preserves 100 % accuracy of the data: 
• The translated data retains its semantic meaning. 
• The translated data retains the same level of 
accuracy as the original data (the representation unit 

and value of a datum is not modified). 
• The translation mechanism for the data used by the 
sending party is deterministic. 
 The data is to be handled in 

the mapping under specific 
rules 
The mapping method introduces an acceptable deviation from 
100 % accuracy: 
• The translated data has a lower level of accuracy 
than the original. 
Both parties, especially 

the requesting party, 
are to evaluate 
whether the deviation 

is acceptable. This 

typically depends on 
operational aspects of 
the requesting party. 

For example, a loss of 

accuracy on location 
data might still be 
acceptable to prove 

facts at the granularity 

of the new accuracy. 

 In case the deviation is 
determined to be not 

acceptable, the data is 

to be handled outside 
of the mapping, 
through the 

originalPayload 

mechanism. 
The data cannot be handled 

within the mapping, the 

original data is to be handed 
over as originalPayload 
The mapping method(s) available, if it were used, would not 
allow to preserve data accuracy, and is therefore not to be 

used: 
• The translated data would have different semantic 
meaning. 
• The translated data would purport to have better 
accuracy than the original data. 
• The translation mechanism for the data used by the 
sending party would not be deterministic - part of the 

data would thus be "random".

Comment
 The data is to be handled in the 
mapping 
The translated data remains complete 

(the translation process does not filter 
out part of the data). 
 The data is to be handled in the 
mapping under specific rules 
The mapping method introduces an 

acceptable deviation from data 

completeness. The translated data is a 
filtered version of the original data. 
Both parties, especially the requesting 
party, are to evaluate whether the 

deviation is acceptable. This typically 
depends on operational aspects of the 
requesting party. For example, a loss 

of completeness in the form of the 

oldest events being filtered out, but the 
more recent ones remaining in the 
data set, might still be acceptable. 

 
In case the deviation is determined to 
be not acceptable, the data is to be 
handled outside of the mapping, 

through the originalPayload 

mechanism. 
The data cannot be handled within the 

mapping, the original data is to be 

handed over as originalPayload 
The translated data is an augmented 

version of the original data. 
  It is recommended that both parties aim for a thorough esta
blishment of valuation indicators for each data translation 
when establishing the mapping. It is further recommended th
at the valuation indicators a
nd selected handover method 
for each data type are indicated in the mapping documentation
. An example evaluation of the valuation indicator on 
accuracy is given in Annex D of the present document. 
The assurance on translation accuracy and data trustworthiness depends on the overall chain of events that are related to 
the processing and handover of the data from the trusted domain of the responding party to the trusted domain of the 
requesting party. This involves in particular: 
• Gathering of the data by the responding party. 
• Possible filtering of the data by the responding party. 
• Translation of the data from the national format into the relevant ETSI format by the responding party. 
• Reception of the data by the requesting party. 
• Any additional processing required by the requesting party (such as filtering of the data). 
NOTE: One reason for filtering data is the existence of legal requirements forbidding the sending or processing of 
certain types of data. 
Through this chain of events, methods are required to ensure 
information security as well 
as accuracy. This includes, for 
example: 
• Identification of the translation methods and indicators of
 translation accuracy as defined earlier in the present 
clause. 
• Hashing mechanism. 
• Version numbering. 
• Packing and transmitting of the original payload and indication of format to serve as reference. 
The valuation indicators can also be used by the requesting party for the automatic identification of the data source. 

This can be a useful feature for personnel relying on the data, as this avoids time-consuming manual checks against the 

mapping documentation. There is however no straightforward way to transfer the information as part of ILHI. One 

approach is to use a separate machine-
readable configuration file, which would then need to be managed as any other 
documentation asset of the mapping (see clause 5.2.2 of the present document). 
  ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 18 Last but not least, when the mapping method introduces an acceptable deviation from 100 % accuracy or from data 
completeness, it is recommended that the requesting party cons
iders the ability of data processing system (outside the 
boundary of the handover interface) to distinguish between data that has not gone through a mapping and data that has 

been subject to a mapping where specific rules are required 
for the handling of said data (refer to Annex D of the 
present document for examples). How to conduct this evaluation is out of scope of the present document. When the 

distinction is not possible, it can be preferable to hand over the data unmodified, through an instance of originalPayload. 
6.3 Information on parameters not defined in the ETSI format 
When an equivalent parameter does not exist in the ETSI destination format, the following approaches are identified: 
• The original parameter is ignored, and this is indicated in the mapping table. 
• The national parameter field is used, and this is also indicated in the mapping table. 
• The original payload parameter (in ILHI convention) is 
provided, and used by the receiving party to extract the 
parameter. 
A field is to be added to the mapping table, indicating how non-supported parameters in the destination format are 
provided by the sender. When the original payload (in ILHI 
convention) is used, this field can include information on 
how the payload is structured and the relevant parameters encoded. Most importantly, it includes information on fields 
in the original payload that are relevant to a given topic,
 as agreed by administrators, allowing further automatic or 
manual processing on the receiving end. One possible solution is the use of the originalPayload field (as defined in 

ETSI TS 103 462 [i.5]) where the identifier field is set to a value reserved for the mapping and the structure of the 

originalPayload field described through a dictionary, following an approach similar to that of ETSI TS 103 120 [i.4], 
where ETSI TS 103 280 [i.10] is used as reference for the equivalence of parameters when appropriate. It is 
recommended that a national authority operating with a national format maintains a single mapping profile of fields not 

supported in the ETSI format into the original payload parameter, in order to avoid discrepancies in cross-border data 

exchange with multiple authorities.

declare or close a new structure. The designer is free
 to express nested structures, fields as they see fit 
within the above table. The same goes for field and structure names. 
 6.4 Mandatory parameter in the destination format that is not 
available in the source format 
There can be cases where the destination format expects a mandatory parameter that is not available in the source 
format - for example, because such parameter is not considered relevant in the source format. This can be solved by 

using values in the destination format that represent the unavailability or inapplicability of the data (e.g. NULL in SQL), 

henceforth named inert values. Depending on the semantic of the parameter in the destination format, such inert value 

can be natively supported and used without requiring an extension of the destination format nor a modification of 
existing implementations. The concept of inert values is 
best illustrated by the NULL marker as defined in the 
Structured Query Language (SQL), which is used to indicate 
that information is not present (hence, the NULL marker is 
different from the value 0). 
  ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 20 When the requesting and responding parties envision the use of an inert value, it is recommended that they consider the 
following steps: 
1) An inert value is supported in the destination format 
and can be used to replace a value expected from the 
source format. This usability is verified up to the application layer and within existing implementations of the 

requesting parties. 
2) An inert value is not available, but an alternative value can be selected, which achieves the same purpose, as 

with the previous point. 
3) No solution based on an inert value or equivalent alternative value is available. In this case the requesting and 

responding parties cannot take the mapping in operation, and an alternative solution is to be found, which is 

out of scope of the present document. 
6.5 Information that can only be provided by deduction 
In some cases, information that is required by the destination format can be deduced from the source format. For 

example, a destination port can be deduced from a protocol identifier. When using such methods, the accuracy of the 

deduction is to be considered. 
6.6 Parameter values that do not match across formats 
A variant to clause 6.3 is that a parameter can have semantic
ally different values across two formats. In such case, there 
is no other choice but to extend the destination format with new values for a parameter, that semantically match those in 

the source format. 
 Figure 6.6-1: Approaches on not identified information on parameters in the ETSI format 
6.7 Handling of information loss 
As introduced in clause 5.4, some translation methods can
 result in information loss. This is the case where the 
translation results in a loss of accuracy, or when the destination format cannot be updated to support a new parameter or 
parameter value that is present in the source format. Whether such information loss is critical in view of clause 4.3 is to 
be analysed by the issuing and executing authorities and depends on each parameter and the expected technical and 

legal effect of the loss, on a case-by-case basis.

-11) 21 6.8 Translations requiring an out-of-band request 
Some translations can require an out-of-band mechanism to translate one parameter to another. For example, the LIID 
according to ETSI TS 102 232-1 [i.6] might not be present in a national format. A supporting function for out-of-band 
requests would be required to perform such translation during processing. A translation could be needed during the 

following phases: 
• At the moment a request is received from the requesting party by the responding party, in order to prepare the 

gathering of data on the side of the responding party. For example, the responding party might resolve a target 
identifier to the subject's identity, and from there reso
lve the subject's identity into all target identifiers the 
responding party is aware of. This implies that the responding party maintains capabilities for identifying and 
retrieving such relations (e.g. in the form of database lookups) or searching for them (e.g. in the form of full 

text search). 
• At the moment data in a national format is being translated into the format as specified in the ETSI TS 102 232 

([i.6] for part 1) family of specifications. For example, a separate service would be used to request an LIID as 
an alias to a national identification number and, if such alias does not yet exist, to register it. This implies that 
the responding party maintains a facility allowing creation, and long-term storage and lookup of such 

information. 
6.9 Details relevant to mappings into national formats 
6.9.1 Handling of parameters that ar
e not defined in the national format 
It is possible that some fields in the ETSI format will have no equivalent in the national format. If it is needed to 

preserve such fields, then extensions to the national formats may be necessary. However, the ability of existing 

implementations that are using the national format, to cope with such new extensions, is to be verified before deciding 

on an extension. This includes parsing, storage, search, and display of the field value to the user, among other aspects. 
6.9.2 Non extensible national format 
When the destination format cannot be extended, it can be
 useful to consider an out-of-band mechanism to carry 

dedicated data objects in order to convey in raw form the in
formation that could not be translated, typically using the 
grammar of the requesting LEMF (for example, ASN.1, XM
L or XML Schema) and adapting the data structure to hold 

a reference allowing a binding with the data sent as part of the destination format. This can be used to convey 

unsupported parameters or parameters holding unsupported values in both the LI and LD domains, and give the 

receiving LEA an opportunity to request further information about those or save them for later analysis. It is 

recommended that the receiving LE
A identifies the information that will be 
provided as extension to the destination 
format, and consider obligations with regard to the processing of such data (for example, there may be data that the 
requesting LEA may not be allowed to process, such data is typically discarded by the responding LEMF or discarded 
by the requesting LEMF before further processing). The following flow chart provides an example of handling non-

extensible destination format. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 22  Figure 6.9.2-1: Example handling of non-supported parameter 
within a national format (done by the requesting LEMF) 
6.10 Requirements on input data 
Before the responding LEMF processes data through the mapping function, it is recommended that the following 
characteristics of the input data are validated: 
• Unmodified data
: - The responding LEMF checks that the input data to the mapping function is the original data as was 

provided by the CSP. 
• Compliance to the defined mapping
: - The responding LEMF checks that there is no 
unknown
 value or parameter in the input data set, that 
cannot be translated through the defined mapping. 
• Qualified data
: - For data that requires a qualifier, the responding LE
MF checks that the qualifier is present (e.g. for a 
timestamp, a time zone is present or inferable)
. Enforcing these characteristics can be done through 
technical means or a legal framework that is applicable
 to the local jurisdiction. For example, it could be 
mandated that timestamps appended to digital eviden
ce collected in a given jurisdiction be assumed to be 
in the local time zone when there is no time zone information. 
• Qualified processes
:  - When the digital evidence, that is being provided as input to the transformation engine, is itself the result 
of a transformation, the responding LEMF checks that process which led to the digital evidence is clearly 
identified and described. For example, when materi
al evidence is being digitized (typically, a scanned 
version is obtained from a paper contract), the requ
irements on the process, equipment and operator are 
clearly described and identified. While this aspect in
 not part of the response to the requesting LEMF 
itself, it can be an important factor to the continuity of data assurance.

   ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 23 6.11 Handling of errors and fail-safe behaviour 
6.11.1 Generalities 
The introduction of a transform between a dataset in a national format and a dataset in the ETSI format introduces a 
new potential point of failure. In order to avoid losing data or sending incorrect data, a responding LEMF can 
implement error handling mechanisms. At the most basic level this includes safekeeping and reporting of incorrectly 
formatted input data (refer to clause 6.10 of the present document), avoiding silent errors in the transformation engine 

(i.e. any execution path that does not lead to output data is to be reported), as well as the queuing and rescheduling of 

transforms that require out-of-band requests, until the services
 providing resolution of out-of-band requests are available 
again. It is recommended that transforms that can be resc
heduled are also subject to a configurable maximum timeout, 
such that a system operator can be timely informed of any delays in providing information to the requesting LEMF. 
In addition, it is likely that not all transform errors can be handled at the level of the system operator. It is therefore 
recommended that alternative means of 
providing the data to the requesting LEMF be agreed beforehand among 
administrators, and that processes are set to handle errors 
due to a misconfiguration of the mapping, e.g. to update the 
mapping arrangements. 
6.11.2 Advanced scenarios 
Many options for handling errors are possible, the following is a non-exclusive list of examples: 
• The LEA operating the requesting LEMF is not interested in some of the possible data types that the 
responding LEMF may return. Such data types that are not relevant can be communicated to the responding 
LEMF, for example through a bilateral agreement managed by administrators, or as part of the mapping. When 

an error occurs on a data type that was indicated as
 not relevant by the requesting LEMF, the responding 
LEMF can ignore the offending data type. It is recommended that the error still be recorded and attended to, as 

the interests of the requesting LEMF may change over time. 
• The raw data that is causing the error is packed and se
nt as-is to the requesting LEMF, which may be able to 
interpret the data with assistance from the authority managing the responding LEMF. While details for such 

arrangement are out of scope of the present document, it is recommended that alternative means for 

transferring data between two LEMFs and for interpreting the data are put in place by administrators to give 

good assurance that the requesting LEMF obtains the requested data. 
• System updates, software errors, or hardware errors, may cause temporary failures with the transformation 
engine, which can be handled with deferral of protocol requests or routing the requests to a secondary 
endpoint. Ideally, both the requesting and the responding LEMF would be operating under principles of high 

availability. It is recommended that bilateral agreements cover service level agreements and the resolution of 

system unavailability through secondary channels. 
7 Operational aspects 
7.1 Overview 
The present clause provides guidance for the setup of operational aspects of cross-border data exchange between two 

LEMFs. The intent is not to be prescriptive but rather highlight the various aspects that can influence connectivity and 

performance aspects when two information exchange sy
stems are interconnected. A checklist summarizing the 
guidance in the form of action points is provided in Annexes B and C. The present document makes no assumption 
whether the agreed operational aspects are made public or ke
pt private as part of bilateral agreements, or to which 
degree of detail such operational aspects are addressed. 
The aspects covered in the present clause include: 
• Interconnects, routing and transport in clause 7.2. 
• The higher OSI layers in clause 7.3. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 24 • Trust and assurance in clause 7.4. 
• Security in clause 7.5. 
7.2 Interconnects, routi
ng and transport aspects 
It is beneficial to identify early on the topology requirements for interconnection. The endpoints of a LEMF could be 
accessible on the public internet, reside on a private ne
twork accessible through a gateway, or require access through 
leased lines. Other configurations are possible. Practical asp
ects to considers include routing, identification of network 
errors, and, for the proper performance of higher protocol layers, available end-to-end bandwidth, MTU and round-trip 
times. Protocol encapsulation, packet or frame processing 
and forwarding, as well as cryptographic functions operating 
at the network layers in hardware or software can all affect performance. 
The choice of interconnection between LEMF endpoints influences the trust and security models to be put in place: 
security requirements will be different, for example, between an approach based on domain security and firewalls, and a 

zero-trust approach. 
Key parameters to agree can include, in an exemplary and non-limitative manner: protocol types, MPLS labels or 
VLAN tags, and scrambling boxes or VPN configuration information (protocol, endpoint addresses and ports, security 
parameters such a algorithms and keys). 
It is to be noted that national authorities may rely on publicly available information exchange infrastructure, such as file 
upload or e-mail services, for the transfer of LI and LD data 
at national level. In such cas
e, adaptation is required to 
provide an end-point compatible with cross-border data exchange protocols. 
7.3 Higher OSI layers 
Key aspects to consider include the choice or protocols at
 transport, session, and presentation layers, including the 
transactional model. Most of these aspects are standardized in ETSI TS 102 232-1 [i.6], ETSI TS 103 462 [i.5] and 

other relevant ETSI and 3GPP specifications, however the following parameters may also be considered for 

performance reasons: 
• Where possible, PDU size at various protocol layers to en
sure efficient transfer of large files. In particular, 
identification of all protocol encapsulation overhead is paramount to avoid inefficient packet fragmentation by 

intermediary network elements (which are configured 
according to known MTU), that can result in packet 
drops. 
• Data retransmission features and configuration thereof. 
• Size of in-memory and on-disk transmission buffers. For example, the maximum size of a single file and the 

maximum size of data transferred in a single session can be defined to ensure that receiving endpoints are 

configured accordingly and fitted with enough hardware capacity. 
• Default timeouts for established sessions, keepalive methods and frequency, and session resumption 

arrangements. 
• Failure modes and error reporting. In particular, situat
ions where a system cannot fail gracefully, for example 
by queuing and rescheduling of transfer attempts, or canno
t transfer information under 
time constraints, are to 
be identified and error reporting allowing operator intervention implemented. 
• Maximum number of parallel sessions (or open connections per host). 
7.4 Trust and assurance 
The assurance that the data provided by the responding LE
MF can be trusted by the requesting LEMF is an essential 

aspect to consider, in particular for digital evidence. Several options are possible. 
One option is to consider that the authentication of the responding LEMF and integrity protection on the data provided 
by the transport or session layer between the responding LEMF and the requesting LEMF are enough to provide 
assurance on the legitimacy and integrity of the data. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 25 Another option is to rely on the digital signature mechanisms in ETSI TS 102 232-1 [i.6] to provide assurance on the 
provenance and integrity of the data from the responding LEMF to the requesting LEMF. With this latter approach the 

responding LEMF is responsible for maintaining assurance internally and the requesting LEMF is responsible for 

maintaining the continuity of assurance after the data has been received from the responding LEMF. 
In both cases data assurance can be maintained at each step 
of the data preparation by the responding LEMF, transfer to 
the requesting LEMF, and further processing by the requesting LEMF. The following steps illustrate an example 
approach based on digital signatures: 
a) The responding LEMF uses locally defined methods for maintaining assurance on digital evidence within their 

jurisdiction (e.g. a hash-based mechanism as defined in ETSI TS 103 643 [i.11], or another method, is 

implemented by the LEA operating the responding LEMF). 
b) The responding LEMF prepares the digital evidence and filt
ers away those security artefacts that are used to 
maintain data assurance in the domain of the responding LEMF. 
c) The responding LEMF ensures that the digital evidence th
at is input to the transformation engine fulfils the 
assurance requirements applicable within their jurisdiction. 
d) The responding LEMF ensures that the digital evidence that
 is input to the transformation engine fulfils the 
characteristics requirements (as derived from the agreed
 mapping framework) applicable to the input data. 
e) The responding LEMF ensures that the mapping config
uration fulfils the requirements of the mapping 
framework agreed with the requesting LEMF. 
f) The responding LEMF performs the data transformation and applies a digital signature to the resulting data 

according to ETSI TS 102 232-1 [i.6]. 
g) The requesting LEMF assumes that assurance on the digital evidence is provided by the responding LEMF by 

virtue of the ETSI TS 102 232-1 [i.6] compliant digital signature applied to the data transformed into the ETSI 

TS 102 232-1 [i.6] compliant format. 
NOTE: These steps are meant for the responding and requesting LEMF. The CSPs are not involved in the above. 
LEAs are likely to have differing approaches to handling trust but need to find common grounds for cross-border data 

exchange. For example, the use of the above approach requir
es agreement on the digital signature algorithm(s) to be 
used and on key management methods, including processes pertaining to a trusted authority, which can be a trusted 

third party. It is recommended that LEAs involved in cr
oss-border data exchange identify their data assurance 
requirements and carefully select which measures to implemen
t, such as those described in steps a) to f) above, in 
particular based on the risks, technical or legal, that can be introduced by any candidate measures. 
The E-evidence homepage maintained by the EU Commission services [i.12] can help finding further information on 
requirements for cross-border data exchange including continuity of assurance. 
7.5 Security 
It is recommended that the mapping or bilateral agreement 
between authorities covers the security aspects of data 
transfer between the LEMFs. It is further recommended that
 the following properties be considered across the complete 
network and protocol stack: 
• Confidentiality of communication, including the exposure of the LEMF as a network function related to law 

enforcement (non-detectability) and the identification of authorities. 
• Integrity of communication. 
• Authentication, authorization, and acco
untability of peers at any layer. 
• Integrity and proof of origin of transferred LI and LD data. 
  ETSI ETSI TR 103 727 V1.1.1 (2021
-11) 26 Setting up protocol security between two LEMFs requires administrators to agree on configuration parameters as part of 
the mapping or bilateral agreement for all of the involved protocol layers, as illustrated in clauses 7.2 and 7.4 of the 

present document. Access control mechanisms at the session and application layers can also require specific 

configuration. This includes agreeing on stakeholders' roles as trusted third parties, and on the management of user 

identities, shared secrets, public keys and/or certificates, as 
well as the semantic value of digital signatures, when these 
are used - e.g. as in clause 7.4. It is therefore possible that the authorities will have to act as Certificate Authorities, or
 rely on trusted third parties for such purpose. It is beneficial for the authorities to identify the security measures that can
 give assurance on the validity and usability of the data as legal evidence. As with clause 6.11 of the present document, it 

is recommended that authorities have processes in place to monitor errors related to security mechanisms, and for 

handling those that relate to usability. Examples includes removal of users, failures with key rotations, expirations of 
certificates, and revocation of certificates. Certificate revocatio
n is prone to many weaknesses and shows its limits in 
emergency situations. Polling mechanisms introduce delays while push mechanisms have scalability issues and are 
sensitive to communication failures. In any case, active monitoring is required to ensure all parties are up to date. 
NOTE 1: These examples are illustrative, the actual scope of errors to monitor and handle depends on the actual 
deployment. 
NOTE 2: Other aspects of security, such as the instantiation of the LEMF, are also relevant although not in scope of 
the present document. 
While not directly related to the security of the ILHI, it is recommended that LEAs consider security measures for 

communications related to the operations of the ILHI, such as communications between administrators, and backup data 

transfer method. Examples for the former include secure messaging and teleconference services, and for the latter 

server-based or messaging-based secure file transfer methods. 
The E-evidence homepage maintained by the EU Commission services [i.12] can help finding further information on 
requirements for cross-border data exchange including continuity of assurance.

Mapping catalogue 
A.1 Overview 
The present annex provides a placeholder for publicly av
ailable mappings. It can be extended as new mappings 
becomes available. To illustrate some of the principles laid out in the present document, an exemplary mapping between 
the German TR TKÜV 7.1 [i.8] and ETSI TS 102 232-2 [i.1] is provided in clause A.2. 
A.2 Example mapping for e-mail: German TR TKÜV 7.1 
and ETSI TS 102 232-2 
A.2.1 Overview 
The present annex provides an example of how a mapping could be defined, taking as illustration a possible way of 

mapping between the German e-mail xml-schema and the ETSI TS 102 232-2 [i.1] ASN.1 format. The German e-mail 

xml-schema taken as reference in the present example is the Technical Guideline TR TKÜV 7.1 [i.8] for implementing 

legal measures for telecommunications surveillance and information disclosure (Annex F, Specifications for storage 

equipment for the e-mail service). No assumption is made as to the compatibility of this mapping against any other 

versions of TR TKÜV [i.9]. It
 is recalled that a mapping is always define
d against a specific version of a technical 
specification (refer to clause 5.2.1 of the present document). 
The version in English of Technical Guideline TR TKÜV 7.1 [i.8] is provided for information only. While encoding the 
element and parameter names of the national based solutions (e.g. XML-Codecs in Annexes E and F) the corresponding 

German terms are to be used. Furthermore in cases of wrong or misleading translations the German version of the 

Technical Guideline supersedes this translation. 
Throughout the present annex, in order to avoid confusion, parameters originating from ETSI TS 102 232-1 [i.6] and 
ETSI TS 102 232-2 [i.7] are named 
fields
, while parameters from TR TKÜV 7.1 [i.8] are named 
elements (following 
the XML convention).

available within the data format of the responding party, but not supported in the ETSI format. Instead, this information 

can be handed over within an instance of originalPayload. 
In the context of the present mapping, the originalPa
yload instance could contain the following elements: 
• <Versionskennung>/<version>. 
• <Datensatzart>/<type of data set>. 
• <Referenznummer>/<LIID>. 
• <Kennung des zueA>/<target ID>.

Some of these elements can be used to populate a LI-PS-PDU header. 
NOTE: the parameter <Ausloesegrund-zueA> is kept as it can contain more information than the status field (in 
case of error).

The German TR TKÜV 7.1 [i.8] XML DTD for e-mail has no element to embed extensions, but one could be defined. It 

is left for further study what to do with unsupported fields that cannot contribute to the <hi3-email> element. 
A.2.3.2 Mapping of parameter names 
The elements in the <hi3-email> element are mapped to the fi
elds in the target PDU according to table A.2.3.2-1 below.

<version
> In TR TKÜV 7.1 [i.8] this is a free text field providing the interface version. It is 
assigned by the obligated party's telecommunications system. 

 
Several options are available for this element: 
1) report the version of the entire interface, for this use the OID of the LI-PS-PDU 
or, if present, the value of the Version field 
 NOTE: The Version field is specified in ETSI TS 102 232-1 [i.6] clause 5, but is not 
present in the ASN.1 specification in clause A.2. 
 
2) confine the version reporting to the EmailPDU and use the OID of the EmailPD 
<Datensatzart> 

<type of data set>
 This element is always assigned the value 'Report'. 
<Referenznummer> 
<LIID> To be assigned the combination of authorizationCountryCode and LIID fields found in 
the header of the enclosing LI-PS-PDU. 
<Zuordnungsnummer> 
<message identifier> 
To be assigned the value of the message-ID field, if present, from the EmailIRI PDU. 
The message-ID can also be obtained by parsing of the e-mail, if an EmailCC PDU is 

provided. 
<Kennung des züA> 
<target ID>
 TR TKÜV 7.1 [i.8] provides the identity under interception directly as part of the 
<hi3-email> element handed over to the LEA. This is not the case with the LI-PS-

PDU, which provides the LIID, and where the mapping between the LIID and the 

identity (or identities) under interception is negotiated between the CSP and the LEA 
outside of the HI2 and HI3 interfaces. 
 
For the value of this element to be trustworthy, the entity performing the conversion 

has to be able to request the mapping between the LIID and the identity under 
interception. If the mapping leads to multiple target identities, then uncertainty on the 
correctness of the element is introduced. 

 
The alternative approach to use the combination of eventType, protocol-ID, 
e-mail-Sender, and e-mail-Recipients fields
 is also bound to introduce such 
uncertainty.

 A.2.3.3.2 Translation from e-mail-Sender and e-mail-Recipients fields to <Partner-
Kennung> < ID of the involved partner > element 
The <Partner-Kennung> element is to receive a copy of the 
values stored either in the e-mail-Recipients or in the 
e-mail-Sender field, depending on the protocol and whethe
r the e-mail was sent or received by the identity under 
surveillance. The decision whether to copy from the e-mail-Recipients or the e-mail-Sender field depend on two 
criteria, the protocol in use and the value of th
e eventType field, according to table A.2.3.3.2-1.

NOTE 3: in cases where the e-mail-Sender and/
or e-mail-Recipients field are not provided, but 
an EmailCC PDU is available, the addresses of the sender and of the recipients can 

be extracted from the e-mail body. This ap
proach would however miss the recipients 
in blind carbon copy (bcc).

ETSI TS 102 232-2 [i.7], clause A.2.3 is not clear on this, but it is 
assumed that indication of a "successful transfer" is from the point of 

view of a receiving SMTP server (i.e. that the message will be 
transferred to a mailbox, for example using LMTP). 
 Other values of the evenType field are to be ignored.

Analysis
 status-unknown(1) 'unbekannter Fehler' 
(see note) 
This mapping would need to be updated for new values of 
the status field that could be specified in a future version of 
ETSI TS 102 232-2 [i.7].  

Such update would be of little consequences to 

implementations supporting the German TR TKÜV 7.1 [i.8], 

as the <Ausloesegrund-zueA> element embeds a free text 
string (only the presence or absence of the 'erfolgreich' 
value has significance). The situation is different for the 

operator having to act on the value of this element, and who 

may benefit from an official translation of the error code and 
from a reference semantic. 
operation-failed(2) 'allgemeiner Fehler'
 (see note) 
operation-succeeded(3) 'erfolgreich' 
NOTE:
  This value is not defined in TR TKÜV 7.1 [i.8], it would need to be defined in a conversion profile.
