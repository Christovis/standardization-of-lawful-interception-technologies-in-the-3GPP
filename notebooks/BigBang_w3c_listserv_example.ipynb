      "3GPP TSG-SA3 Meeting #84-LI-e-a s3i220038r5 Online, , 24th Jan 2022 - 28th Jan 2022      First change   7.11.2.2 Signature generation The IRI-POI present in the Telephony AS or IBCF, shall generate an xIRI containing a STIRSHAKENSignatureGeneration record when the following conditions are met: - Telephony AS or IBCF is interacting with the SIGNING AS. Whether it is the Telephony AS or IBCF for sessions is based on network configuration and local policy of the CSP. Whether it is IBCF for MSISDN-less SMS is based on network configuration and local policy of the CSP. - P-Asserted Identity or From header of SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request received from S-CSCF is a target identity. - A PASSporT is received from the SIGNING AS and is included in an outgoing SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request in a SIP Identity header. - Based on RFC 8946 [76], SIP retargeting creates a new Identity header signed by the SIGNING AS and containing the \"div\" claim to attach to the session.  The following table contains parameters, with IRITargetIdentifier, generated by the IRI-POI. Table 7.11.2.2-1: Payload for STIRSHAKENSignatureGeneration record  Table 7.11.22-2: Details for identityTokens parameter  Table 7.11.2.2-3: Details for identityTokenHeader parameter  Table 7.11.2.2-4: Details for identityTokenPayload parameter  Second change 7.11.2.3 Signature validation The IRI-POI present in the Telephony AS or IBCF, shall generate an xIRI containing a STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation record when the following conditions are met: - Either IBCF or Telephony AS, is interacting with the VERIFICATION AS. Whether it is the Telephony AS or IBCF for sessions is based on network configuration and local policy of the CSP. IBCF for MSISDN-less SMS, is based on network configuration and local policy of the CSP. - Request URI and To Headers of SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request received from S-CSCF (in the case of Telephony AS) or from the previous IP network (in the case of IBCF) is a target identity. - If a PASSporT is received in the SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request, it is submitted by the Telephony AS or IBCF to the VERIFICATION AS for validation and the result is included in an outgoing SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request together with possible RCD data or eCNAM data as Call-Info headers.  The IRI-POI present in the LMISF-IRI or P-CSCF shall generate an xIRI containing a STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation record when the following conditions are met: - Request URI or To header of SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request sent to the UE is a target identity. - SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request sent to the UE includes SIP Call-Info headers containing possible RCD data or eCNAM data, and the result of the PASSporT verification.   The following table contains parameters, with IRITargetIdentifier, generated by the IRI-POI. Table 7.11.2.3-1: Payload for STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation record  When the termination network performs SHAKEN verification, one of the following values shall be assigned to the SHAKEN validation result parameter as part of the display information: \"TN-Validation-Passed\", \"TN-Validation-Failed\", or \"No-TN-Validation\". In case of TN-Validation-Failed, the SHAKEN failure status code shall be present and coded as an integer. The SHAKEN failure status codes are at least, according to RFC 8224 and to IANA Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters [75]: - 403 \"Stale Date\" response code is sent when the verification service receives a request with a Date header field value that is older than the local policy of the CSP for freshness permits. The same response may be used when the \"iat\" has a value older than the local policy of the CSP for freshness permits. - 428 \"Use Identity Header\" response code is sent when the verification service receives a SIP request that lacks an Identity header. This is to indicate that the request should be re-sent with an Identity header. - 436 \"Bad Identity-Info\" response code is used to indicate an inability to acquire the credentials needed by the verification service for validating the signature in an Identity header field. - 437 \"Unsupported Credential\" response code is used when the verification service cannot validate the certificate referenced by the URI of the Identity-Info header, for reasons such as failing to trust the issuing certification authority (CA) or failing to support the algorithm with which the credential was signed. - 438 \"Invalid Identity Header\" response code is used to indicate that of the set of Identity header fields in a request, no header field with a valid and supported Identity token has been received.

Whether it is the Telephony AS or IBCF for sessions is based on network configuration and local policy of the CSP. Whether it is IBCF for MSISDN-less SMS is based on network configuration and local policy of the CSP. - P-Asserted Identity or From header of SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request received from S-CSCF is a target identity. - A PASSporT is received from the SIGNING AS and is included in an outgoing SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request in a SIP Identity header. - Based on RFC 8946 [76], SIP retargeting creates a new Identity header signed by the SIGNING AS and containing the \"div\" claim to attach to the session.  The following table contains parameters, with IRITargetIdentifier, generated by the IRI-POI. Table 7.11.2.2-1: Payload for STIRSHAKENSignatureGeneration record  Table 7.11.22-2: Details for identityTokens parameter  Table 7.11.2.2-3: Details for identityTokenHeader parameter  Table 7.11.2.2-4: Details for identityTokenPayload parameter  Second change 7.11.2.3 Signature validation The IRI-POI present in the Telephony AS or IBCF, shall generate an xIRI containing a STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation record when the following conditions are met: - Either IBCF or Telephony AS, is interacting with the VERIFICATION AS. Whether it is the Telephony AS or IBCF for sessions is based on network configuration and local policy of the CSP. IBCF for MSISDN-less SMS, is based on network configuration and local policy of the CSP. - Request URI and To Headers of SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request received from S-CSCF (in the case of Telephony AS) or from the previous IP network (in the case of IBCF) is a target identity. - If a PASSporT is received in the SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request, it is submitted by the Telephony AS or IBCF to the VERIFICATION AS for validation and the result is included in an outgoing SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request together with possible RCD data or eCNAM data as Call-Info headers.  The IRI-POI present in the LMISF-IRI or P-CSCF shall generate an xIRI containing a STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation record when the following conditions are met: - Request URI or To header of SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request sent to the UE is a target identity. - SIP INVITE or SIP MESSAGE request sent to the UE includes SIP Call-Info headers containing possible RCD data or eCNAM data, and the result of the PASSporT verification.   The following table contains parameters, with IRITargetIdentifier, generated by the IRI-POI. Table 7.11.2.3-1: Payload for STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation record  When the termination network performs SHAKEN verification, one of the following values shall be assigned to the SHAKEN validation result parameter as part of the display information: \"TN-Validation-Passed\", \"TN-Validation-Failed\", or \"No-TN-Validation\". In case of TN-Validation-Failed, the SHAKEN failure status code shall be present and coded as an integer. The SHAKEN failure status codes are at least, according to RFC 8224 and to IANA Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters [75]: - 403 \"Stale Date\" response code is sent when the verification service receives a request with a Date header field value that is older than the local policy of the CSP for freshness permits. The same response may be used when the \"iat\" has a value older than the local policy of the CSP for freshness permits. - 428 \"Use Identity Header\" response code is sent when the verification service receives a SIP request that lacks an Identity header. This is to indicate that the request should be re-sent with an Identity header. - 436 \"Bad Identity-Info\" response code is used to indicate an inability to acquire the credentials needed by the verification service for validating the signature in an Identity header field. - 437 \"Unsupported Credential\" response code is used when the verification service cannot validate the certificate referenced by the URI of the Identity-Info header, for reasons such as failing to trust the issuing certification authority (CA) or failing to support the algorithm with which the credential was signed. - 438 \"Invalid Identity Header\" response code is used to indicate that of the set of Identity header fields in a request, no header field with a valid and supported Identity token has been received.

At meeting start the Agenda and previous meeting report will automatically be approved and all documents in agenda items 2 and 3 noted without further review on the email reflector.  Deadlines as of Meeting Start:  Start of e-meeting:  2nd March   14:00 ETSI Time Official Conf Calls  3rd / 4th March   14:00 – 16:30 ETSI Time Email List Last comment: 4th March   16:00 ETSI Time End of e-meeting:  4th March   17:00 ETSI Time  Conf Call link:   Conference Call Agenda / Initial Timing Allocations   Please note that actual timing and allocation of individual agenda items is subject to change and update during the e-meeting, in order to best utilise the time available.  Based on the input to the meeting it is expected that 1 or more calls may be cancelled and all calls may be reduced in length.  1.2 Agenda & Working Procedures     1.3 IPR Call Reminder  The Chair reminds delegates of their company\\'s obligations under their SDO\\'s IPR policies:  The attention of the delegates to the meeting of this 3GPP Sub Working Group is drawn to the fact that 3GPP Individual Members have the obligation under the IPR Policies of their respective Organizational Partners to inform their respective Organizational Partners of Essential IPRs they become aware of. The delegates are asked to take note that they are thereby invited:     to investigate whether their organization or any other organization owns IPRs which are, or are likely to become Essential in respect of the work of 3GPP.     to notify their respective Organizational Partners of all potential IPRs, e.g., for ETSI, by means of the IPR Information Statement and the Licensing declaration forms.  The attention of the delegates to the meeting is drawn to the fact that 3GPP activities are subject to all applicable antitrust and competition laws and that compliance with said laws is therefore required by any participant of the meeting, including the Chair and Vice-Chair and are invited to seek any clarification needed with their legal counsel. The leadership will conduct the present meeting with impartiality and in the interests of 3GPP. Delegates are reminded that timely submission of work items in advance of TSG/WG meetings is important to allow for full and fair consideration of such matters.   2 TS 33.126 Target: TS33.126 R17 to be Frozen for SA#92 in Jun 2021.
